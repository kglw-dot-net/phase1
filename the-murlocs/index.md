<!-- TODO -->
The Murlocs is a Garage/Blues Rock band fronted by Ambrose, featuring Cook on bass, and fleshed out with a semi-flexible crew from Melbourne. Formed around the same time as KGATLW, they have maintained a very respectable output between the many album releases and tours of their bigger and weirder counterpart. Their material is often a reflection of whatever Ambrose was contributing to KGATLW at the time, and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of his idiosyncratic voice and signature harmonica wail.
