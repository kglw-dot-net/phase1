    <p>Welcome to Phase 1 of kglw.net.</p>

<p>While the site has been running in a prototype state since October 19th 2022 to define goals and mobilize the team, we have now achieved a baseline of features that allow the site to function as intended<!-- spread like lava rise like bread -->.
<!--snippet--></p>

<p>Assembled by a passionate core, a team of web developers, artists, live show enthusiasts, and writers have come together out of the woodwork of the King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard fan base to produce this first dedicated hub. Scattered far and wide across the realms of social media and forums, many have envisioned similar projects, but it has taken a larger unified community effort to finally make the successful launch of a project that can serve its own purpose, with its own means, on its own terms.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this project has been twofold:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The landmark 2022 King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard North America tour has not only fulfilled the much delayed and highly anticipated marathon shows at Red Rocks (<a href="/setlists/2022/10/10/red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co.html">Night 1</a>, <a href="/setlists/2022/10/11/red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co.html">Night 2</a>, <a href="/setlists/2022/11/02/red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co.html">Night 3</a>) — it is the first conducted since the band approved uploading of audience tapes to archive.org, permanently preserving the first renaissance of the King Gizzard live show and marking the genesis of a fully formed taping and ‘lot’ culture surrounding the band.</li>
  <li>This year has also been special for studio releases; somehow managing to surpass the legendary five-album run of 2017 with the same feat plus the addition of a collaborative EP, remix album, documentary, debut cinema release, and several Official Bootlegger live and demo releases. This has all been capped off with ‘Gizztober’, a new level of output frequency with the final three studio albums of the year all unleashed within the month of October. Busy periods of activity such as these tend to bring in waves of new fans, and are remembered as significant reference points in the history of the band; if you are new to King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard in 2022, welcome :)</li>
</ul>

<p>The nature of this fan-hub is loosely based on existing ‘jam-band’ fan sites and taping culture — connected to the early days of the internet itself, these have provided an open-source development ethos favouring community preservation and freedom of information.</p>

<p>Of course, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard are much more than ‘just’ a jam-band (though what jam-band isn’t?) as such, the live show taping and archiving scene is not the sole focus of this site.<br />
The deep and dense discography of recorded releases has provided us with what has come to be known as the Gizzverse; this can be both a daunting prospect for new listeners, and a vast span for fans to connect across. Featuring biographical information, introductory guides, reviews, stories, and much more, kglw.net is the outpost serving the various inter-galactic routes of Gizzverse explorers.</p>

<p>Our key features:</p>

<h2 id="live-show-setlists"><a href="/setlists">Live Show Setlists</a></h2>

<p>This is the primary function of the site. Here, you will find the most up-to-date catalogue of every King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard live show, including detailed and annotated setlists, dates, locations, and pertinent notes.<br />
As the band have developed the quality of their live show and scope of their tours significantly in the last few years, they are gradually aligning with the culture of established live-focused jam acts such as Phish or The Grateful Dead. All the while, a need has grown for a custom and community-integrated site, providing unique features beyond what existing tools like setlist.fm can manage. <!--Using data from that site as a start, it has been reformatted and each of nearly 700 entries has been manually checked and edited into a more consistent syntax; making the most complete and up to date King Gizzard live show set-list catalogue available anywhere.--></p>

<h2 id="the-gizzverse-guide"><a href="/gizzverse-guide">The Gizzverse Guide</a></h2>

<p>There are several existing guides to the King Gizzard discography, introducing new listeners to so many different releases is no simple task, especially in a way that is both user-friendly and easy to keep relevant. Some readers may be familiar with the Gizzverse Guide, an interactive flowchart-inspired written guide formerly hosted on the <a href="http://boilerrhapsody.com">Boiler Rhapsody music blog</a>; this has now found its proper home on kglw.net. 
Every <a href="/releases">release</a> has a dedicated page containing the cover artwork, objective information, description, and salient facts on its significance within the Gizzverse as a whole. Then, a series of links are provided that can be followed based on what you already know or like about the music, forming a network structure that highlights multiple creative veins through the discography as it developed — or just gives a recommendation on what to listen to next.
The shareable starting point of the Gizzverse Guide with various strategies for how to approach the material can be found <a href="/gizzverse-guide">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="interview-archive"><a href="/interviews">Interview Archive</a></h2>

<p>Much information about the Gizzverse comes from the extensive catalog of interviews featuring members of the band, so kglw.net contains the much-sought-after first archive of these interviews. The page is our newest feature and is a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="request-for-contribution">Request for Contribution</h2>

<p>kglw.net is built by the community for the community, and will always be strengthened by more input. We are currently seeking:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Missing setlist information, many performances from the band’s first few years have little information available. If you attended a King Gizzard live performance in the first half of their career, please check if you can fill some missing information. Whether it be files still saved in cloud storage, social media posts, or in cases where there is no other information available, even just your memory. Even the names of opening acts and what was played as pre-show hype music over the house speakers is valuable.</li>
  <li>Interesting stories from live performances. Were you there when Ambrose passed around a foot-long joint, or to carry Stu over train tracks to the nearest body of water? We want to hear about significant happenings in personal detail, please include the date of the performance.</li>
  <li>Photos you have taken of the band performing with permission for us to use them on the site. Please consider the quality of photography is the main factor in how useable it will be; phone images taken in the dark from the crowd are unlikely to be necessary. We are also seeking high quality portrait-style photos that you can provide permission for us to use in the <a href="/band-bio">band bio</a>.</li>
  <li>Interviews missing from the archive. While some are already lost to time, many are out there and just plain missing. If you can remember an old interview and how to access it, please let us know.</li>
  <li>Fan art with details for how you would prefer to be credited</li>
  <li>Gizzverse themed creative writing. While the most out-there theories are best posted by yourself, the community has a lot of valuable thinking on what is in the Gizzverse and what it means. Please remember, well developed/thought out/backed up theories and higher quality of writing provided means less editing and more chance we can feature it in a meaningful way.
<!--* Other King Gizzard-based community projects. Are you working on something else and not sure how to connect it with other fans? Let us know, we may be able to collaborate, or at least feature it.--></li>
</ul>

<p>We are reachable with the social media accounts at the bottom of the page, or by email at: kglw.net@gmail.com</p>

<h2 id="the-kglwnet-roadmap">The kglw.net Roadmap</h2>

<p>Phase 1 is only the beginning. The current site has taken a lot of work and is a nice proof of concept, but it will not serve all of our long term goals. Subsequent phases will see drastic improvement to the set-list features. For example, a custom site back-end will allow detailed statistics to be shown, breaking shows down by year, tour, city, or even how frequently certain songs transition into other songs. Significant headway has already been made in this direction, and will continue to brew as we go.<br />
But there are also bigger plans beyond this:</p>

<p>King Gizzard and The Lizard Wizard are passionate about the environment, and have always shown great consciousness of their privilege and position not only through their art, but their actions and many charitable donations.
This is a passion we hope to reflect in the site. In the long term, kglw.net intends to form and operate alongside an environmental themed non-profit organization. This will allow us all to begin to make real differences in the issues we are all concerned about as fans of the music — the fragility of the environment around us.
This is a project that will grow out of the site, with an established community in line with the cause as a prerequisite; others are already making small moves in this area and we see you.</p>

<hr />

<p>We all have a long journey ahead; https://phish.net/ began as an email list before at least one member of King Gizzard was born. The band have been at it for over a decade and it has always felt fresh, not only is there a lot of existing content to yet fill the site, there is much, much more to come.<br />
Anyone is welcome in the Weirdo Swarm as a fan of the music, and kglw.net extends this inclusivity; with the simple restriction of hate speech and discrimination. The music is sometimes dark, but is always best appreciated with a positive attitude.<br />
Keep enjoying the music, attending shows, spreading the word, and enjoy the site! You will hear from us soon.</p>
