"That's a word that I — don't, know where it even came from", was Stu's carefully worded response when asked about the 'Gizzverse' in early 2017.  
<!--snippet-->
In the now-lost interview by Veronica & Lewis on national Australian alternative radio station [Triple J], Stu was clearly conscious of not speaking too much power into the concept that had just started to grow beyond his control.  

The word had begun circulating in fan groups in the wake of 2016's [_Nonagon Infinity_](https://kglw.net/releases/nonagon-infinity); the album (being recursive itself) had highlighted the recursive nature of a set of themes and elements in the group's material, truly connecting these concepts across albums for the first time.

Stu had only recently — and inadvertently — announced that multiple albums would be coming throughout 2017 on that very same radio station, so after the first few teases of the upcoming material began appearing in late 2016 (live performances of unreleased songs, music video Easter eggs) straight into the mounting hype, the Gizzverse theory suddenly took-off.

This was manifested in the first Gizzverse diagram, posted to [the KGATLW subreddit][reddit] by [u/theonewhossecond](https://www.reddit.com/user/theonewhossecond) on [January 30th, 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/5qupcy/the_gizzverse/):

![first gizzverse diagram Jan 30 2017 u-theonewhossecond](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209906751-cb58a7af-a655-4a87-b8c9-701feeba6071.jpg){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

The frenetic nature of the diagram immediately attracted equal parts interest and derision. Some aspects are simple facts and undeniable, while others tenuous or confusing enough to be written-off as schizoid pareidolia. So remains the nature of the Gizzverse, perpetuated by a cult-like core of dedicated believers in opposition to the cynical outsiders, locked in denial of the seemingly random dots in front of their eyes.

Though careful with his words, Stu did eventually concede some insight in that interview:  

> They all exist in this parallel universe and they're maybe from different times and different places but they all can co-exist in a meaningful way. They’re being more and more connected and the second album we’re going to put out this year [Murder Of The Universe] links some things too, and is the most narrative-driven record that we’ve ever made.  

Interestingly, former band member/manager Eric had this to add:

> Before we started a band we knew what the last album was gonna be and what the first album was gonna be. They’re all connected...

---

So what are the actual connections that form the Gizzverse, and what makes them special? One of the simplest can be seen by comparing the cover artworks for _Nonagon Infinity_ and its predecessor, [_I’m In Your Mind Fuzz_](https://kglw.net/releases/im-in-your-mind-fuzz):

![IIYMF and Nonagon covers side-by-side, showing visual similarity via colors and ominous imagery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209906803-95a25f3b-2728-4124-a7c6-31c0ddb334d3.png){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

The Prog-Rock aspect of the music would always tend to produce character and narrative based songs, and these now had a defined environment — the castle floating above the clouds atop the misty jagged mountain central to the background of both covers.

Intriguingly, these connections were not only retroactive additions, but showed clear foreshadowing. For example, the red-cloaked figures on the _I'm In Your Mind Fuzz_ cover with transparent faces never really seemed to have any bearing on that album, with no other reference or explanation for their presence. But two years later, _Nonagon Infinity_ gave us the track "Invisible Face", with these lyrics:

```
I distort the notion of the place  
The universe's other face  
The speed of light has slowed apace  
The universe's other face  

What it is  
Impossible  
Gravity  
The universe  
Has me  
Invisible  
Face  
```

The 'invisible faces' of the red-robed characters now seem to indicate ability or experience of some extreme warping of the universe, exposing its 'other face' with a reduced speed of light and impossible gravity.  

'Nonagon Infinity opens the door'; aside from being a clear nod to [Aldous Huxley's _The Doors Of Perception_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception) (this book is among the first literary descriptions of the influence of psychedelics), it is clear that this door opens between some form of parallel universes (or is that the same thing?).

Depending on how deep you're willing to look, these connections span the vast majority of the discography. Most cohesive theories would place _I'm In Your Mind Fuzz_ as the first solid foundation, but a case could be made for the cover artwork of 2013's [_Oddments_](https://kglw.net/releases/oddments). Making up a little world of its own, the lyrics of this album dont really seem to relate to the many characters and scenes that comprise the visual feast, yet some of them bear striking resemblance to imagery that would pop up again and again through the years; various reptilian creatures, warped or decaying sinister buildings, visual patterns, esoteric robed figures, sludgy liquid textures, etc.

![Oddments extended artwork, with dense and colorful yet muted cartoon imagery of faces and footprints and window and pathways](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209906936-047e6c1b-5fc0-4a2a-990f-328ef71584f5.png){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

It is even possible to spot the character that appears on the cover artwork for the group's debut album [_12 Bar Bruise_](https://kglw.net/releases/12-bar-bruise). This was the first work contributed to the band by visual artist and de-facto seventh member Jason Galea; who has become responsible for the vast majority of visual King Gizzard material.  

![12 Bar Bruise cover, showing a green reptilian holding a golden sword in front of a red background](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209906958-058f16e3-2b07-4e01-822c-b48aa7f24c6f.jpg){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}


Before getting too hung up on the very first instance of a singular call-back between releases, it is worth noting that the infinite-loop concept of _Nonagon Infinity_ (using segues between every song) had been conceived of and at least attempted for _I'm in Your Mind Fuzz_, resulting in the medley of connected songs that opens the album — such is first of the truly pre-meditated and properly executed links that travel both ways between two releases, the several of which between these albums combine into a sort of temporal wormhole that define their status as the true galactic centre of the home-system of the Gizzverse.

Given the quote from Eric above about how the band decided what their last album would be before they even fully formed, nothing is truly off the table.

If you are looking for an indication into which albums lean most into Gizzverse lore, the presence of Han-Tyumi is your key. First introduced in 2017's [_Murder of the Universe_](https://kglw.net/releases/murder-of-the-universe), the character has a distinct voice, generated by text-to-speech software (known as 'Charles (UK)', it is commonly used in many applications). Han-Tyumi was the last naturally born human being, a time long forgotten since his attainment of immortality as a cyborg. Han-Tyumi has an important figurative position in the Gizzverse, indicated by the anagram of his name — he is the personification of ***humanity*** itself, and our endless pursuit of technological advancement and exploration of the universe. This makes him a very effective symbol to measure many concepts against, and these fill the lyrics of many King Gizzard songs to provide Stu's perspective on environmentalism, physiology, trans-humanism, metamorphosis, politics, atomic physics, altered mental states, and many other topics through the discography.

The most direct Han-Tyumi narrative is _Murder of the Universe_, featuring an extended sequence describing his experiment to gain some of his humanity back, resulting in the implosion of universe itself caused by an engulfment of vomit.  

He also pops up as a more subtle influence in [_Sketches of Brunswick East_](https://kglw.net/releases/sketches-of-brunswick-east), where his god-like hubris is established by mirroring the conversation between God and Moses from the book of Exodus.  

Some of his other appearances are more esoteric, such as a surprise vinyl-only Easter egg to conclude [_Polygondwanaland_](https://kglw.net/releases/polygondwanaland), revealing that album to contain the story of his first step on the path to become a cyborg; with an eye modification allowing perception of a fourth primary colour.  Or the reversed message buried in the mix at the end of [_Fishing For Fishies_](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies), extolling dancing as the means by which human consciousness was elevated out of our origins in Africa and taking us all the way to the stars. <!-- preshadowing "Hate Dancin"?? -->

The cover artwork for this album also first confirmed what he looks like, establishing another way to make connections that may also run all the way back to _Nonagon Infinity_, where we discover he may have been the topic of the song _Robot Stop_. In the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p_Si21ig7c&t=185s) for this song, the design of the robot bears strong resemblance to the _Fishing For Fishies_ cover (the video also contains another tease of the then-unrevealed flying microtonal banana, the guitar central to the forthcoming [album](https://kglw.net/releases/flying-microtonal-banana) of the same name) — you can see how we begin to establish the endless web of possible references defined only by how willing you are to thematically connect one aspect of one release with any other aspect of any other release.

![Robot-Stop+FFF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209906981-2fa21a7e-ca87-411d-af95-5ceabcf3dd35.png){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

If that is a lot to take in, take comfort in the ambiguity of it all. Despite (or because of?) the themes of existential dread and divine influence upon the mundane aspects of the human experience, _Sketches of Brunswick East_ is for the most part a very chill Stoner-Jazz record, and usually considered as not much more than that.  

The ending of it all has already been revealed, _Murder Of The Universe_'s post-quantum evisceration of the fabric of reality itself is the ultimate levelling of the playing field. As for everything else, the beauty is that there are few rules to what is considered prequel, sequel, linear, or even relevant at all.  

One of [Frank Zappa](https://www.zappa.com)'s more progressive theories of art was his 'conceptual continuity', the idea that each work was not just a singular piece to be judged on its discrete merit, but only a small part of a large body of work containing everything the artist put out; particularly that the entire thing must be comprehended to be better judged. As a recording artist, his many albums made up the majority of this artwork, but he considered any part of the process even down to his interview appearances as significant parts of the whole. A key part of the 'continuity' aspect was the recurring use of musical motiffs, these could be guitar riffs, lyrical references, melodies, or any other part of the music that Zappa would frequently re-use from prior releases.  

The Gizzverse is similarly formed. Whether it be the bassline from the _I'm In Your Mind Fuzz_ medley popping up in _Murder of the Universe_, or a more subtle hint to a _Nonagon Infinity_ riff in _The Dripping Tap_ from [_Omnium Gatherum_](https://kglw.net/releases/omnium-gatherium), there are many of these through the King Gizzard discography.
  
These are also convenient touchpoints to the works of other artists. This is sometimes done lyrically, such as with the appearance of [J.R.R. Tolkien's Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog) in _Murder of the Universe_. But music is the universal language, pretty much anything composed on standard instruments is just a reinterpretation of what others have done in the past, a good opportunity for conscious acknowledgements.

A very recognisable one is the use of the ['Arabian Riff'](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Arabian_riff) (i.e. "there's a place in France where the ladies go to dance") in _I'm Not In Your Mind_. Being at least three hundred years old, this melody has been reinterpreted innumerable times all around the world.

Another obvious one would be "The River" from [_Quarters!_](https://kglw.net/releases/quarters), based heavily on [Paul Desmond & Dave Brubeck's "Take Five"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Five). Not only is this Jazz standard famous for its jammy length, "The River" also shares its 5/4 time signature and is composed of extremely similar melodic shapes and rhythms. The "Tale of the Altered Beast" chapter of _Murder of the Universe_ also significantly borrows Brubeck melody shapes and an unusual time signature. This time in 9/8, the plucky guitar that often underlies the narration of The Reticent Raconteur is an interpolation of [Brubeck's "Blue Rondo à la Turk"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rondo_%C3%A0_la_Turk); which itself is inspired by a traditional Turkish rhythm (King Gizz had only just released precceding album _Flying Microtonal Banana_, based on Turkish instrument tunings).  

Connections like this can go on to an endless depth. Considering where else Brubeck may have been inspired for "Blue Rondo à la Turk" might bring you to a very well-known tune at the time, [Paul Abraham Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer's_Apprentice_(Dukas)), which had recently been used as the theme in Disney's _Fantasia_. If you listen to this [theme in reverse](https://youtu.be/Er4RFAmfh-M?t=192), it sounds eerily like the passage referenced by King Gizzard from _Blue Rondo à la Turk_; but if this sounds like an oblique connection, just consider the visual influence _Fantasia_ may have on the Gizzverse by comparing its Bald Mountiain to the mountain from the album covers:

![Disney's depiction of Bald Mountain, next to the covers of I'm In Your Mind Fuzz and Nonagon Infinity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114916472/209907006-3c659408-6c75-4c14-afca-c3625022648a.jpg){: style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

We have barely begun to scratch the surface.  

The Gizzverse is not a singular cohesive story, but an interconnected web-like network of references — not only a set of song lyrics, characters, images, and themes, but something larger defined as much by fans connecting the dots as the band generating them.  

Therefore, everyone has a unique take on the Gizzverse, and for too long it has remained disconnected and vague, mostly explained through uninspired comments or rambling diatribes.  

There is a vast mythos awaiting.
