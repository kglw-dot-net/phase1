The Red Rocks marathon shows are the pinnacle of the King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard live performance. Originally announced in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic saw the performancess delayed for over two years. The highly anticipated completion of these shows has even seen the band re-emerge with another major stylistic shift into a new golden era with a whole new demographic of King Gizzard fans all of a sudden faced with with just how much the band means to them.

So, Rigo Garcia and friends decided to capture this big moment in their excellent fan documentary: 1063 Days: A King Gizzard Mini Documentary.

"Gizzard's putting out this stuff, thats like 'we're on this wavelength', and everyone else is riding that wavelength as well. Its like this wild communal thing. Its like today's Grateful Dead in a way. Its like a certain kind of fire thats been lit by this torch thats been passed. Maybe the torch looks different, but the fire is the same."
"It speaks to this thing inside of you thasts sort of yearning for a little bit more, thats kind of questioning. Its as little bit off the wall, but it also doesn't give a fuck. Its sort of punk, but then its also super lighthearted. Like the whole Weirdo Swarm aspect, embrace that inner-child silliness inside you. Also embrace the rage thats inside of you. Theres a lot of philosophical shit about it, but then its also very playful. So its hitting on all these things that just encompass the human experience in a multitide of ways, it hits that broad spectrum of things and I think people just grab onto that"

"I think Gizzard just stands for everything I stand for, the climate crisis, to women's rights, human rights, indiginous rights. Everything they write about, their music, their whole essence is about making this world a better place â€” but also just being badasses and saying 'fuck the system', and 'fuck the world and everything thats happening' because this world is bullshit."


One interview-ee who didn't think they would be able to make it to the shows and had no ticket is a great example of how a passion for the band can spread. As when their local hiking community found out how dissapointed they would be to miss out who hiked 1500 miles to attend the shows
"All four of us just met them, and its like proof more than anything. You kind of get the feeling before you meet them, that they're actual class-act guys, real stand-up people trying to move through the world in the best, least harmful way they can."

"Theres so much creativity amongst the fanbase. A lot of it is that spirit that theres a lot of generosity amongst the fanbase. Giving stuff to people, or making something that really speaks to somebody. At the end of the day its just a metal pin or whatever, but it speaks to this music, it speaks to this band. Its everything that is about, cause you never know what somebody's going through in their life, and this music speaks to them
