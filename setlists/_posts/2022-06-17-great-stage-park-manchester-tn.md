#### Notes

This show was part of the 2022 [Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival](https://www.bonnaroo.com/) and was held in “That Tent”.  Robot Stop was played as an homage to the live debut of Robot Stop at Bonnaroo in 2015 and contained Hot Water teases.  Following Planet B Joey shouted out [Tool](https://toolband.com/), who was also playing at the festival (but on a different day to his chagrin) and then teased "[The Grudge](https://youtu.be/3BXyEUOuNds)" (Tool).  Gaia featured a drum solo by Cavs.

This show was released through the [Official Bootlegger program](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) as [Live at Bonnaroo ‘22](https://kglw.net/releases/live-at-bonnaroo-2022/).
