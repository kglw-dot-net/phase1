**KGLW.net Staff Notes:**

The setlist for this show is believed to be complete, but only partial recordings exist. KGLW.net staff was only able to confirm KGLW (Intro), Doom City, Straws in the Wind, Nuclear Fusion, Honey and K.G.L.W. (Outro) through audio or video recordings. Despite the incomplete recordings, KGLW.net staff believes the setlist is complete based on contemporaneous discussions through various social media, but any additional setlist notations that requires audio confirmation (segues, quotes or teases) may be incomplete. If anyone has any further information or, ideally, a complete or conclusive recording please contact KGLW.net staff at [kglw.net@gmail.com](email:kglw.net@gmail.com).
