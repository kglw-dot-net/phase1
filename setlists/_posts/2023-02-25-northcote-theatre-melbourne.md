#### Notes

Gaia featured a drum solo by Cavs followed by an extended full band metal vamp.  Slow Jam I contained Iron Lung teases.  Lava, Gamma Knife and People-Vultures were on the [written setlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/11bk10l/melbourne_25223/) as the final three songs but were not played.
