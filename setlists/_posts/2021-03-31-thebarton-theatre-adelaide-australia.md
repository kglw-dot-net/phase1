#### Notes

This show featured the live debuts of See Me and The Hungry Wolf of Fate.  Sleep Drifter contained Nuclear Fusion teases.  Nuclear Fusion did not include the throat singing intro.  Prior to Pleura Stu led a call-and-response chant with the audience, leading Joey to ask “[Freddie Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkbP5OPQhdQ) who?”  Pleura was introduced as a song about Blu-Ray.  The Hungry Wolf of Fate was printed as “The Hungry Wolf of Fire” on the written setlist.
