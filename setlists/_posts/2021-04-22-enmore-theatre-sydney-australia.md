#### Notes

As requested by Joey, Ambrose provided the vocal intro to Nuclear Fusion. Straws in the Wind contained Nuclear Fusion teases. The Book featured a Cavs drum solo. Before Supreme Ascendency, Joey remarked that the crowd and venue reminded him of [The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby). [Tropical Fuck Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Fuck_Storm) was shouted out before The Hungry Wolf of Fate. This show was Released through the [Official Bootlegger program](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) as [Live in Sydney â€˜21](https://kglw.net/releases/live-in-sydney-2021/).
