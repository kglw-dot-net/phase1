**Notes**: This show was part of Play on Victoria, a celebration of the return of live music following the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.  Also performing at this event were Amyl and The Sniffers, Baker Boy, Vika & Linda, and Grace Cummings.  This show featured the debuts of Shanghai and Gaia.  I'm Not In Your Mind contained Alter Me teases. Baker Boy and Amyl and The Sniffers were shouted out before Muddy Water. Gaia was introduced as being "in drop D, the Korn tuning".  Gaia and Self-Immolate featured brief drum solos from Cavs.  The Bitter Boogie was dedicated to "Sexy" Sam Sutton.
