#### Notes
This show featured the live debut of Gila Monster. Honey contained Billabong Valley teases.  Iron Lung contained Hypertension teases.  Joey shouted out opening act [Los Bitchos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Bitchos) after Ambergris. Self-Immolate featured a drum solo by Cavs followed by an extended full band metal vamp. The intro to Am I in Heaven? featured an atypical, bluesy jam, and an interesting story from Joey about he and Ambrose, and subsequently featured ["Stairway to Heaven"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway_to_Heaven) [(Led Zeppelin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin) quotes.
