#### Notes

The show began with a drum solo leading into Venusian 2. Before Predator X, an "Asheville Gatherum" shirt was thrown on stage, and Stu changed into it. Slow Jam 1 contained Ice V and Magenta Mountain teases. Magenta Mountain was dedicated to Robert "Bob" Moog. Nuclear Fusion featured Lucas on the intro vocal instead of Joey. Another t-shirt was thrown up on stage after Iron Lung; Stu thanked everyone for the t-shirts noting that "I fucking stink like shit so it's perfect." After Stu declared that "showers are for squares," Ambrose then suggested that Stu had never had a shower in his life, "only golden ones." Wah Wah contained The River teases and quotes. The Dripping Tap contained The Land Before Timeland teases.
