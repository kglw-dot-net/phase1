#### Notes
Joey shouted out [Los Bitchos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Bitchos) at the start of the show.  Evil Death Roll was introduced as a song about crocodiles and contained The Dripping Tap and Trapdoor teases. Alter Me I contained an Ice V tease. Billabong Valley and Honey contained Sleep Drifter teases. The Grim Reaper contained an unknown quote and an additional verse from Sadie Sorceress. Los Bitchos joined the band for Trapdoor.
