**KGLW.net Staff Notes**: The setlist for this show is believed to be complete, but only partial recordings exist. Recordings of K.G.L.W. (Intro) and Automation are unavailable and several other songs are incomplete.  The missing songs were confirmed based on the preannounced song lists for each of the 5 planned genre specific shows and contemporaneous discussions through various social media, but any additional setlist notations that require audio confirmation (segues, quotes or teases) may be incomplete.
