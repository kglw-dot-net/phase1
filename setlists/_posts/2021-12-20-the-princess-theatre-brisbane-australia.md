Recordings of Sleep Drifter and Straws in the Wind are unavailable and most other songs are incomplete.  The missing songs were confirmed based on the preannounced song lists for each of the 5 planned genre specific shows and contemporaneous discussions through various social media, but any additional setlist notations that require audio confirmation (segues, quotes or teases) may be incomplete.
