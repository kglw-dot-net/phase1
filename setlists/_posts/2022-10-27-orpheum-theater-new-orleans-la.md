#### Notes

Evil Death Roll did not include the Invisible Face section and instead featured a Hypertension-esque jam (see below). The intro to Ambergris featured musical banter regarding a "big-ass beer". [Leah Senior](https://leahsenior.bandcamp.com) was shouted out prior to Crumbling Castle.

**KGLW.net Staff Notes:**  
There was a good deal of discussion about whether the jam in Evil Death Roll constituted a Hypertension tease or was merely suggesting a variation on Hypertension through Stuâ€™s playing. We decided that this example did not qualify as a "tease", "quote", or full "jam." Rather than expand our lexicon to include "motif" or "theme," we opted to simply mention and qualify it in the setlist notes.
