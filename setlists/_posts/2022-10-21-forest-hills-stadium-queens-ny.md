#### Notes

Honey contained Sleep Drifter teases and Rattlesnake teases. The Sleep Drifter outro -> to O.N.E. contained Billabong Valley teases. [Leah Senior](https://leahsenior.bandcamp.com) and [Black Midi](https://bmblackmidi.com) were shouted out after O.N.E. Gaia featured a Cavs drum solo over a metal vamp from the band, which also contained People-Vultures teases. After the solo, Joey lamented that they didn't have another drum set to hold a drum battle between Cavs and Morgan of Black Midi. Iron Lung contained Hypertension teases.
