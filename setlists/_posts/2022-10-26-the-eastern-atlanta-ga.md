#### Notes

It was announced prior to the show that Stu was late to the stage because he had "diarrhea or something". Stu then entered the stage costumed as "Disco Stu" and noted that it was his birthday show. Persistence was stopped partway through for a cake "being fucked by a sexy alien" to be presented to Stu, and for the crowd and band to sing "Happy Birthday to You" to Stu, after which Stu passed out the "cake full of drugs" to the audience. Persistence was finished after the mid-song break. The River contained Wah Wah teases and an Ice V tease. [Leah Senior](https://leahsenior.bandcamp.com) was shouted out before Lava. At the end of the show, Stu was hit with [silly string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_String) by the band while the audience sang to him again.

**KGLW.net Staff Notes:**  
Fans of stage banter will want to seek out this show for humorous birthday comments throughout the show, and other amusing banter about being drunk and the Satanic nuns that often appear at their shows.
