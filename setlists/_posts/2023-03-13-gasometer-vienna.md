[^1]: With Cavs drum solo.

#### Notes
Gaia featured a drum solo by Cavs with an extended metal vamp by the band and contained an unidentified quote, possibly from a new song. Shanghai featured alternate, improvised lyric phrases from Stu, different from 2023-03-09, but still based around the "Let's get real high" refrain. Joey shouted out [Jon Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gordon_(musician)) during Work This Time. The Dripping Tap contained Cellophane teases. The River contained Iron Lung teases.  Trapdoor was listed on the printed setlist after Muddy Water but was not played.
