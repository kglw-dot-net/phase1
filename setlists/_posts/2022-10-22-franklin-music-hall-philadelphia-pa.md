#### Notes

The Grim Reaper contained Sadie Sorceress quotes. Alter Me III and Altered Beast IV were performed with Leah Senior providing the narration. Evil Death Roll contained Alter Me teases and a full Hypertension Jam, which would debut properly the following night.

**KGLW.net Staff Notes:**  
For questions about why we noted a Hypertension Jam in the actual setlist for this show and not [27 October 2022](/setlists/2022/10/27/orpheum-theater-new-orleans-la.html), for example: Here, a significant portion of Hypertension is played by the entirety of the band for nearly two minutes before returning to the composed section of Evil Death Roll. This not only justifies us mentioning it in the setlist notes, but also adding a Hypertension Jam to the setlist itself. We believe it is enough of a departure from both Evil Death Roll and the Evil Death Roll jam that had developed to list it as such.
