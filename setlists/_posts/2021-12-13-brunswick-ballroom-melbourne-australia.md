#### Notes

This show was a fully acoustic warmup gig for acoustic night of the Princess Theatre residency and featured the debut of Most of What I Like.  The intro to Sense contained "Come On" (The Notorious B.I.G.) quotes.  Following Slow Jam 1 opening band The Bush was shouted out and mention was made that Ambrose's sister Edith is in the band.
