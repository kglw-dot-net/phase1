#### Notes
Rattlesnake contained Automation teases and quotes. Ambrose quoted O.N.E. prior to Straws in the Wind. This Thing was introduced as a song about “being a piece of shit”. Shanghai featured alternate, improvised lyrics from Stu: “Let’s get real high and eat apple pie.” Evil Death Roll contained Shanghai, Mars for the Rich, and Hypertension teases. Joey and Stu shouted out opening act [Los Bitchos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Bitchos) after Evil Death Roll.
