#### Notes
The Grim Reaper contained an extra verse from Sadie Sorceress.  Shanghai featured alternate, improvised lyric phrases based around the “Let’s get real high” and other various refrains.  The Bitter Boogie contained Crumbling Castle teases.  Prior to Lava a small object was passed to Stu from the crowd & the object’s significance and owner were inquired after.  Lava contained Hypertension teases.  Wah Wah contained The River teases.  Los Bitchos were shouted out after Road Train.  It’s Got Old was introduced as “a very old song that will most likely be fucking awesome and very reggae-ish”.  Ice V had the intro and first verse performed without drums and contained Hypertension teases.  Prior to The Dripping Tap Amby introduced the song as the story of his kitchen sink and Joey shouted out one of the front-of-stage security staff who had been dancing to the music.  Amby quoted “So Long, Farewell” (The Sound of Music) to close the show.
