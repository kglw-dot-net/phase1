#### Notes

The date of this show is assumed until properly confirmed. All songs are the earliest known performances as there are no known earlier public performance dates. This show was performed for "assessment moderation purposes" for the [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au) Bachelor of Contemporary Music Performance Exams and featured the first known public usage of the name _King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard_, which was announced at the end of the performance.

**KGLW.net Staff Notes:**  
We note that these are the "earliest known performances" as there is no record of any earlier performances. We definitely know there were earlier performances, just not when, where, or what they played. This performance may have been before Ambrose and Cook joined (or they were just absent/not in the class), but the band already had their name, which we know from interviews took a while to decide on. They were a house party band who wrote their songs pretty much on the fly, so the fact that they had five original songs here tells us they had been performing for a while.
