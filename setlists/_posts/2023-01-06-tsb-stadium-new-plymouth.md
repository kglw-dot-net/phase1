#### Notes

This show was originally scheduled to be at Bowl of Brooklands, but was moved indoors to TSB Stadium due to weather. I'm Not in Your Mind contained The Dripping Tap teases and Alter Me teases and quotes. The River contained Happy Birthday to You quotes and eventually came to a full stop as [Sam][bio]'s birthday was recognized by the band and crowd. Ice V subsequently contained The River teases. The Dripping Tap contained teases from the I'm In Your Mind Fuzz Suite before segueing directly into Cellophane.
