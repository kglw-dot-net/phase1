#### Notes

The start of the show was delayed by 4-5 minutes due to issues with Stuâ€™s guitar/equipment.  There was much humorous banter from the band during the delay. Gaia featured a Cavs drum solo over a metal vamp from the band. The segue from O.N.E. to Sleep Drifter contained a Honey tease. The River contained a Wah Wah tease. The River was reprised during Wah Wah, which also contained a quote of The River.
