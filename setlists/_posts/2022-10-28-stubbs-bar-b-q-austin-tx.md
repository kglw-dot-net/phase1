#### Notes

This show was part of the 2022 [Levitation Festival](https://levitation.fm/) and was held at [Stubbâ€™s Bar-B-Q](https://www.stubbsaustin.com/). Hot Wax was announced as a dedication to a fan named "Joe". I'm Not in Your Mind contained Alter Me teases and quotes. Cellophane contained Am I in Heaven? teases and Hot Wax quotes. Ambergris was introduced as a song about "[the most expensive ingredient in modern humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambergris)." Iron Lung featured an extended [Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers) style intro while Lucas was using the restroom, followed by additional mid-song banter about Lucas. A New World through Altered Beast II featured Leah Senior providing the narration.
