#### Notes

This show was performed as part of a community radio promotion for the Willoughby's Beach EP and featured the earliest known performances of Danger $$$, Lunch Meat, Let It Bleed, Dead-Beat, Dustbin Fletcher, and Willoughby's Beach. Crookedile was dedicated to The Vasco Era vocalist Sid O'Neil (and Cook Craig). Let It Bleed was introduced as "not a Rolling Stones cover or anything". Dustbin Fletcher was introduced as being "named after our favorite Essendon veteran", a reference to Essendon Football Club defender [Dustin Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Fletcher). Stoned Mullet was introduced as being named after a band Stu thought was "really cool" when he was in high school.
