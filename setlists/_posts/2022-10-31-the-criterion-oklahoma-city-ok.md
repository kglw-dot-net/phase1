#### Notes

"Theme from Halloween" was played over the PA prior to the costumed band members walking on stage to a song played over the PA: "P.I.M.P." (50 Cent) for Ambrose, dressed as a pimp, "Mother" (Danzig) for Cavs, dressed as [Glenn Danzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Danzig), "You've Got a Friend in Me" (Randy Newman) for Lucas, dressed as [Buzz Lightyear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear), "'C' Is for Cookie" ([Sesame Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street)) for Cook, dressed as a cookie and throwing cookies into the crowd, "Oompa Loompa #1/Augustus" ([Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka_%26_the_Chocolate_Factory)) for Joey, dressed as an Oompa Loompa, and "Hollaback Girl" (Gwen Stafani) for Stu, dressed as a banana and throwing bananas into the crowd. Additionally, crew for the show were dressed as ketchup and mustard bottles. Robot Stop contained a Hot Water tease. Alter Me was teased during the intro to People-Vultures. Mr. Beat contained a Persistence tease. Before Alter Me II, there was an extended discussion about bananas. Alter Me II through Altered Beast IV were performed with Leah Senior (dressed as a witch) providing the narration. The verses were sung out of order in Altered Beast IV. Stu removed the banana costume prior to Self-Immolate and threw it into the crowd, citing that it was "too hot". Before Doom City, Stu denied a fan request for Catching Smoke saying that they didn't know how to play it. Magenta Mountain featured a lyric change to reference Oompa Loompas. Gaia featured a Cavs drum solo over a metal vamp from the band.
