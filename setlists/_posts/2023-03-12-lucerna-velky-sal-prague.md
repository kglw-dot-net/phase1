#### Notes
Self-Immolate featured a drum solo by Cavs.  Joey and Stu shouted out opening act [Los Bitchos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Bitchos) before Planet B.  Gila Monster was introduced as a track off a new album, after which Stu shouted out [drop D tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_D_tuning).  Ice V contained a quote of “[The Boss](https://youtu.be/jC2ZY2loo74)” ([James Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brown)).  The intro to Gamma Knife contained People-Vultures and Robot Stop teases.  Amby quoted [“So Long, Farewell”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAqLovfRTro) (The Sound of Music) after Iron Lung.
