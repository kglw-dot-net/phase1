---

[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/) are a six-piece band based in Naarm (Melbourne), Australia, and gradually formed in 2010 out of a group of friends mostly fresh out of high school. They largely fall under the umbrella of 'Psychedelic Rock', and with an always independent and totally DIY ethos, frequently switch between a drastic array of styles.

## Musical Band Members

Note: As a group, the guitar playing roles tend to revolve and therefore 'lead' and 'rhythm' titles are less necessary. Two guitars often play accompanying melodies, and solos are rare.

While Stu is the primary contributor and the foundation of studio composition and demo recordings are usually carried out in a trio with Michael and Joey, the band maintain a democratic process where any member is able to contribute or veto ideas at any stage of production. This works with an independent, anti-perfectionist approach using the materials and space around them. The band have attended ‘writing retreats’ together where album ideas are born, and maintain a shared studio/office space where they can go to work.
