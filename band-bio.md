King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are a six-piece band based in Naarm (Melbourne), Australia, and gradually formed in 2010 out of a group of friends mostly fresh out of high school. They largely fall under the umbrella of 'Psychedelic Rock', and with an alwys independent and totally DIY ethos, frequently switch between a drastic array of styles.

In rough order of musical contribution, here are the members:

**Stu Mackenzie** – The ‘front’ of the band, lead songwriter, lead vocalist, and steers the creative direction of the group either with album concepts, or the constant evolution of songwriting and instrumentation. Primary plays guitar and often bass in studio recordings.

**Joey Walker** – The primary of three guitarists, with the occasional lead vocal + songwriting credit, he also composes and performs bass in many studio recordings.

**Ambrose Kenny-Smith** – Occupies a ‘spotlight’ role and provides the group’s signature harmonica wail and live percussion duties. Has the second most vocal and co-writing credits.

**Cook Craig** – The third guitarist, cook also contributes the occasional song + lead vocal in his idiosyncratic style.

**Lucas Harwood** (formerly Skinner) – Lucas is the group’s primary bassist, performing in some studio recordings and all live shows. he has no compositional credits, with bass written mostly by stu or joey who also usually records bass parts in the absence of lucas.

**Michael Cavanagh \[Cavs\]** – The drummer, composes and performs all primary percussion duties.

**Eric Moore** (former member) – Eric began in the band as the secondary drummer, usually playing live in unison with cavs, and rarely recorded for the studio material. Founder and director of Flightless Records, who published the bands material for nearly ten years, and also managed the band up until august 2020 when he departed the group to focus on the label full time.

While stu is the primary contributor and the foundation of studio recordings are usually carried out in a trio with Michael and Joey, the band maintain a democratic process where any member is able to contribute or veto ideas at any stage of production. This works with an independent, anti-perfectionist approach using the materials and space around them. The band have attended ‘writing retreats’ together where album ideas are born, and maintain a shared studio/office space where they can go to work.

Since the split from the band, [Flightless Records](https://flightlessrecords.com/) is now just one branch of an organisation alongside Flightless Distro, a product design/shipping fulfilment facility for the Melbourne record industry, and Flightless Factory, a niche interest record store. The band now self-publish under the 'KGLW' brand.
