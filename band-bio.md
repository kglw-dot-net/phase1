---

King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are a six-piece band based in Naarm (Melbourne), Australia, and gradually formed in 2010 out of a group of friends mostly fresh out of high school. They largely fall under the umbrella of 'Psychedelic Rock', and with an always independent and totally DIY ethos, frequently switch between a drastic array of styles.

## Musical Band Members:

**Stu Mackenzie** – The ‘front’ of the band, lead songwriter, lead vocalist, and steers the creative direction of the group either with album concepts, or the constant evolution of songwriting and instrumentation. Primarily plays guitar and often composes/plays bass in studio recordings, additionally composes with and plays anything with a keyboard, Flute, and Clarinet. Inspired by or formerly played: Sitar, Bağlama, and Zurna.

**Joey Walker** – The primary of three guitarists, with the occasional lead vocal + songwriting credit, and often composes/plays bass in studio recordings. Specialises in Electronic music production and occasionally performs DJ sets.

**Ambrose Kenny-Smith** – Occupies a ‘spotlight’ role and provides the group’s signature harmonica wail and live percussion/keys duties. Has the second most vocal and co-writing credits, and occasionally plays Alto Saxophone.

**Cook Craig** – The third guitarist and occasional keys player, Cook also contributes the occasional song + lead vocal in his kooky Zolo style.

Note: As a group, the guitar playing roles tend to revolve and therefore 'lead' and 'rhythm' titles are less necessary. Two guitars often play accompanying melodies, and solos are rare.

**Lucas Harwood** (formerly Skinner) – Lucas' primary musical role is playing bass live, and occasionally performs in studio recordings.  

**Michael Cavanagh \[Cavs\]** – The drummer, composes and performs all primary percussion duties.

**Eric Moore** (former member) – Eric began in the band as the secondary drummer, usually playing live in unison with cavs, and rarely recorded for the studio material. Founder and director of Flightless Records, who published the band's material for nearly ten years, and also managed the band up until august 2020 when he departed the group to focus on the label full time.

While stu is the primary contributor and the foundation of studio composition and demo recordings are usually carried out in a trio with Michael and Joey, the band maintain a democratic process where any member is able to contribute or veto ideas at any stage of production. This works with an independent, anti-perfectionist approach using the materials and space around them. The band have attended ‘writing retreats’ together where album ideas are born, and maintain a shared studio/office space where they can go to work.

Since the split from the band, [Flightless Records](https://flightlessrecords.com/) is now just one branch of a larger organisation since including Flightless Distro, a product design/shipping fulfilment facility for the Melbourne record industry, and Flightless Factory, a niche interest record store. The band now self-publish under the 'KGLW' brand.
