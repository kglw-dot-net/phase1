            <p>As the dust began to settle from 2016’s [Nonagon Infinity][#NI], fans began to notice a set of recurring themes and elements in the output of King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard.</p>
<p>One of the earliest and most direct of these can be seen by comparing the cover artworks for this album and its predecessor, [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz][#IIYMF]:</p>
<p>![](./The Gizzverse Guide – BoilerRhapsody_files/iiymfnonagon.png)</p>
<p>The Prog-Rock aspect of the music would always tend to produce character and narrative based songs, but these now also got a defined environment – the castle floating above the clouds atop the jagged mountain central to the background of both covers.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, these connections were not only retroactive, but had clear foreshadowing. For example, the red-cloaked figures on the IIYMF cover with transparent faces never really seemed to have any bearing on that album, with no other reference or explanation for their presence. But two years later, [Nonagon Infinity][#NI] gave us the track <em>Invisible Face</em>, with these lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I distort the notion of the place<br />
The universe's other face<br />
The speed of light has slowed apace<br />
The universe's other face</p>
<p>What it is<br />
Impossible<br />
Gravity<br />
The universe<br />
Has me<br />
Invisible<br />
Face</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonagon Infinity opens the [multiverse] door.</p>
<p>⋯</p>
<p>Filmed in early 2017, the band appeared in Amoeba Hollywood’s <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8oexqhDaEo">What’s In My Bag?</a></em> Youtube Series, where artists pick and discuss records. While the rest of the band take the opportunity of shopping in one of the worlds biggest and most popular records stores to pick up some favourite albums and discuss some influences, Stu conspicuously only buys a shirt and a stack of books. Discussing his picks, we discover he is clearly well read, and begin to see the strong influence that written literature might have on his lyric writing, perhaps over other music. Among some choices from his ‘to read’ list (<em>Beowulf, 2001: A Space Odyssey</em>), he picks up an H.P. Lovecraft anthology, stating he ‘is one of my favourite authors’.</p>
<p>One of the earliest progenitors of the modern literary extended universe, Lovecraft is known for his distinct pioneering of ‘cosmic horror’, a unique proto-sci-fi take on the darker themes of Edgar Allen Poe. He died lonely and unsuccessful, having failed to generate commercial interest in his dozens of short stories and novellas during his lifetime. His legacy was instead carried on by a network of authors he had cultivated through highly active letter correspondence, introducing them to each other and encouraging the sharing of their works. The most well known of these is August Derleth, who named the ‘Cthulhu mythos’, made the effort to uncover and publish Lovecraft’s lesser known stories, and connected the thinly spread universe of deities and semi-fictional locations into a more coherent structure through his own writing.</p>
<p>2017’s <em>Murder Of The Universe</em> was the first deep-dive into the Gizzverse, and remains perhaps the most Lovecraftian of their releases as a whole.</p>
<p><img src="https://kglw.net/gizzverse-guide/what-is-the-gizzverse/./images/albums/MOTU.jpg" alt="album cover of Murder Of The Universe" /></p>
<p>Jason Galea’s covert artwork for MOTU is a meticulous 200+ hour oil painting that shows the castle in the air in a highly chaotic and dynamic state of destruction. This depicts the linear ending of the Gizzverse, an all-engulfing torrent of vomit that collapses the very fabric of reality as described in the climax of the album, ‘Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe’.</p>
<p>However, there is plenty else to unpack before we look too closely at the ending. Way back in 2013’s <em>Oddments</em>, the track <em>Work This Time</em> features these lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's kind of funny<br />
That I live the poetry I can not write</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reference lifted directly out of Oscar Wilde’s 1891 novel <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. The full passage runs: “The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”</p>
<p>This idea of transpondence between lived experience and art is an important central theme to the book; in which the titular character has an epiphany on personal aesthetics while sitting for his portrait. Wishing that he could remain beautiful all his life, the painting so exquisitely captures his essence that this wish comes true, and he soon discovers that the painting begins to age in order to preserve his physical appearance. The cursed nature of the wish is realised, as Dorian’s image in the painting also begins to reflect his growing internal corruption and every wrongdoing he makes through the course of an increasingly vulgar life. Later on in the novel, as Dorian has to begin to account for his still-perfect visual appearance and guilt causes him to insist to friends that he is not as he appears, he uses a phrase that also may stick out to King Gizzard fans: “‘Culture and corruption,’ echoed Dorian. ‘I have known something of both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I have altered.”</p>
<p>This brings us back to <em>Murder of the Universe</em>, lending particular insight to its first chapter: ‘<em>The Tale of the Altered Beast</em>’. In an interview with <em>Observer</em> promoting the then upcoming album, Stu did us the favor of breaking down each chapter: “It chronicles a human person being stalked by an Altered Beast, which is kind of a distorted half-creature, half-human, which we can maybe all relate to. Eventually the person is consumed by the beast and becomes the beast himself, goes on to cause more havoc, create more beasts, then he dies. It sounds familiar, you know?”</p>
<p>This may be a rather severe interpretation of <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, but the parallel is clear. Indicated by use of the unusual key word ‘altered’, the murderous beast from the album is equivalent to Dorian Gray, corrupted beyond recognition by a series of heinous acts that either inflict repulsion or death upon those around, or draw them in to the process of becoming altered themselves.</p>
