            <p>How do you get into King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard? Many hear a small sample of this incredible band, but are immediately turned off when faced with what to listen to next out of such a high volume of material.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Gizzverse Guide, a catalogue of KGATLW releases, each with an introductory blurb that establishes its significance within the overall discography. Each entry is linked by attributes that you can use to take you to the next listening suggestion, based on what you already know or like about the music.</p>
<p><strong>What To Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have already heard an album and don’t know where to go from there, navigate to it from the contents list below then follow the prompts (The back button will take you back to the previous album).</li>
<li>If you are completely new to the band, have heard nothing and don’t know where to start, check out some of the strategies below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Essentials</strong></p>
<p>While always debatable, there is a path of ‘essential’ albums that most efficiently shows the core sounds and material that the fan base grew around. For the purposes of this guide, I consider <a href="/releases/im-in-your-mind-fuzz">I’m in Your Mind Fuzz</a> to be the first essential listen. These albums are thereafter referred to as the ‘Gizzverse albums’ in the prompts through the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Chronological</strong></p>
<p>Listening through a discography chronologically is the tried and true way of getting into a band, as it is the way that fans who have followed a band get to experience each album as well. While the sheer volume of albums may feel daunting, they evolve through so many sounds and levels of polish so quickly that if you aren’t liking an album by about the third song, just skip to the next release for something different nearly every time.</p>
<p>Their first album is [12 Bar Bruise]; but if you have heard of the band by some of their newest material, then perhaps starting at the <a href="/releases/changes">current newest album</a> and listening in reverse chronological order may work better for you.</p>
<p><strong>Vibe</strong></p>
<p>Pick an album by title and cover. Each record has a distinct personality that is well conveyed in its title and artwork. <a href="/releases/murder-of-the-universe">Murder of the Universe</a> is as dark and despondent as it looks and sounds, <a href="/releases/paper-mache-dream-balloon">Paper Mâché Dream Balloon</a> as whimsical as the scene on the front, so pick one that jumps out at you.</p>
<p><strong>Visuals</strong></p>
<p>If something isn’t quite ‘clicking’, try some of the visual work as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-i1XZc8ZwA">The video for Rattlesnake</a> is what instantly made me a fan after years of the band just being a funny name on the radio with an occasional stand out track. <a href="/releases/nonagon-infinity">Nonagon Infinity</a> and <a href="/releases/butterfly-3000">Butterfly 3000</a> are albums with lots of high quality visual work behind them.</p>
<p>The band have many great videos all available on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEpdah_kOgfhdncO5YfjdQY9hFzPq-2r">Youtube Channel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playlists</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to experience each album all the way through right away. <a href="/releases/gumboot-soup">Some</a> don’t have overarching concepts, and many are split into shorter suites or medleys. Some songs from different releases even belong together. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rXwufFoJYw">Murder of the Nonagon Fuzz</a> (re-upload) is an impressive fan made album mashup that uses only songs with accompanying music videos, seamlessly connecting five different projects.</p>

<p><strong>Criticism</strong></p>
<p>While music critics and fan bases always clash, due credit for <a href="https://pitchfork.com/artists/32633-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/">Pitchfork</a> and Anthony Fantano at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW8qY_BtlPqcMWd3nn8E8p3rm3YlcFV0d">The Needle Drop</a> for (mostly) giving KGATLW a fair shot.</p>
<p>I also have a couple of KGATLW album reviews published on the blog: <a href="https://boilerrhapsody.com/2018/05/29/album-review-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-murder-of-the-universe/">Murder of the Universe</a>, and <a href="https://boilerrhapsody.com/2022/03/06/album-review-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-fishing-for-fishies/">Fishing For Fishies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Live Material</strong></p>
<p>We are currently in a renaissance of KGATLW live performance. The band was just really starting to settle in as a ‘jam band’ with emphasis on their live show elevated to more than just promotion of their studio releases, when the COVID-19 pandemic paused live music touring for two years. Their several live in-studio performances at KEXP are known for drawing in fans:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W19twyYD2Q">2015 – im-in-your-mind-fuzz/QRTRS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxxz7Tgfsv4">2017 – flying-microtonal-banana</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5Z4bma_tUM">2018 – murder-of-the-universe (Live with crowd)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwu7FYFSek&amp;t=1510s">2018 – POLY/gumboot-soup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnmFKS2eDBA">2019 – infest-the-rats-nest</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are many publications of KGATLW live material out there, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nJOSthA7oUlizlfO3tmEg">fan made crowd recordings</a>, ‘official bootlegger‘ band sanctioned soundboard recordings published by fans, and label published traditional <a href="/releases/chunky-shrapnel">live show recordings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Guides</strong></p>
<p>I am not the first or the last to create a dedicated guide for getting into KGATLW.</p>
<p>Album flowcharts are common in the fan base (and served as inspiration behind many of the connections in this guide). Though clunky to use and constantly out of date, the idea retains an attractive simplicity. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/lysvvz/i_finally_updated_my_king_gizzard_flowchart_now/">Here is the most common one</a>, and some others: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/uhyne5/my_take_on_the_king_gizzard_flowchart/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/j2xore/nonagon_flowchart/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/a2su97/flowchart_i_made_for_a_friend_wanting_to_get_into/">4</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/d4n8sa/i_made_a_venn_diagram_of_their_albums/">5</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://get-into-gizz.com/">https://get-into-gizz.com</a> is a similar, simpler, more streamlined equivalent to this guide.</p>
