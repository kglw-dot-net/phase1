            <p>This genesis of this blog came from the realisation of how much time and energy I was spending commenting about music online, primarily in the KGATLW Facebook fan group. A response from a friend that I had bugged once again about new music prompted the creation of Boiler Rhapsody, which has turned out a much more fulfilling outlet than incessant petty discussion and memes between strangers on Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.</p>
<p>As the years rolled on, I have recognised an increasing need for a tool to help newcomers to the band begin grasping all the music; a task now significantly more complicated than it was in the days I used to spend in the Facebook group answering questions and giving tips.</p>
<p>If you have any corrections, suggestions, feedback or questions please contact me below.</p>
<p>(form)</p>
<p>The Weirdo Swarm is a community full of interesting stories and even if all you have to share is how you got into KGATLW, live show experiences, your tattoo/fan art, other music that sounds like or is inspired by KGATLW, what the band means to you, or if this guide has helped you understand more about the band, I’d love to hear from you as well. (No mailing list, nor is your email address saved for any other purpose)</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of the Gizzverse Guide. It is a tool I have envisioned for a long time and only recently began to piece together how to make it. It is currently built from basic WordPress tools and I am very interested in expanding its functionality, if you are interested and knowledgeable in open-source web development and wouldn’t mind volunteering some time for the sake of improving this guide, I am in much need of it.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute but can’t in an area I have already mentioned, any financial donation would go a long way. This blog is currently non-monetized and it’s overhead costs are out of pocket. One goal is to separate the guide from Boiler Rhapsody with a dedicated domain, and alongside hosting more features and the large amount of content that will eventually fill out the tool, any donation would go directly toward this cause.</p>
