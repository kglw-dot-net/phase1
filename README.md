WIP â€” exploring a simple [Jekyll] setup for Phase 1

## setup

[Using this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

Ensure git is set up

Set up asdf [+ ruby](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby); `asdf install`

`asdf exec gem install bundler`

`asdf exec bundle install`

run the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

control how links are built using the `baseurl` command-line flag: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#running-and-testing-locally

Note that the theme is [v2.5 of Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/2.5-stable) (not the latest 3.0 branch)
