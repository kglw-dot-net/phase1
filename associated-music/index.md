During the formative years of the band, it would have been accurate to describe King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard as everyone's side project. Now, they are the nexus for a range of solo and side acts, peers, collaborators, and even a new generation of bands who draw influence from them.

## Other Music Projects  
Stu is the only member of King Gizzard not actively involved with composing music in other bands or solo projects, tending to focus on only one band at a time while the rest spread out their compositional work.

### The Murlocs  
_The Murlocs_ is a Garage/Blues Rock band fronted by Ambrose, featuring Cook on bass, with Cal Shortal, Tim Karmouche, and Matt Blach playing guitar, keyboards, and drums respectively. Formed around the same time as King Gizzard, they have maintained a very respectable output between the many album releases and tours of their bigger and weirder counterpart. Their material is a more straightforward reflection of whatever Ambrose was contributing to King Gizzard at the time, and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of his idiosyncratic voice and signature harmonica wail.

### Pipe-Eye  
This is the solo project of Cook, who began releasing music under the title in 2015. He typically writes and records all the music alone in his bedroom except drums, which are typically played by Cavs and recorded at King Gizzard headquarters. The music provides an insight into the existence of Cookie, who populates his songs with seemingly mundane topics delivered in a highly idiosyncratic, kooky style that will be recognisable to fans of the handful of King Gizzard songs he has written and recorded vocals for.

### Bullant  
_Bullant_ is the solo Techno/IDM production project of Joey. His debut album _Tyson, Crying_ shows the learning process of Ableton in real time, unable to save a project using the free version of the software, each song was completed in a single session under the stairs at the studio. Beginning in 2019, one could infer that this project was the offshoot of the electronic experiments of King Gizzard such as can be heard at the end of [_Fishing For Fishies_](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies), or in [_Made In Timeland_](https://kglw.net/releases/made-in-timeland).

### CAVS  
In 2021, Cavs released his debut solo self-titled drumming album. A pure expression of his drumming ability, [_CAVS_](https://www.discogs.com/master/2280727-Cavs-Cavs) shows off chops in various percussive styles outside of what he usually gets to play with King Gizzard.

### Heavy Moss  
Still yet to debut, _Heavy Moss_ is a band fronted by Lucas. Since the dissolution of his independent record label _Dusky Tracks_, Lucas has started a new project to develop his musical composition ability, even getting piano lessons for the purpose.

## Prior and Inactive Projects  
Prior to the formation of King Gizzard, each member had already been in an array of bands and musical projects populated with other locals from the Deniliquin, Barwon Heights, Geelong, Angelsea, and Melbourne areas but have since become focused on King Gizzard.

### The Houses  
This was a Garage Rock band formed in 2005 featuring Stu on guitar, Cavs drumming, and Lucas on bass and backup vocals. Other members included Blaise Adamson and Tim Richards. They released one EP and the 2008 album [_Uncle Fever + Aunt Ammonia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vaWolGUpro).

### Sambrose Automobile  
This was a precursor to _The Murlocs_, a Blues Rock band featuring Ambrose and Lucas, also with Sam Cooper, Cal Shortal and Lonnie Carland. They released two EPs and an album, [_Beat Boom Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrfVJicYwuo) in 2009.

### Almacknjack  
_Almacknjack_ was a Garage Rock band featuring Stu on guitar, Almo Troup with vocals, and Jack Robbins (who went solo as [_Forever Son_](#forever-son)). In 2008, they released their only album [_Taste of an Orange_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJMCC1Ommms&t=684s).

### The Lexies  
_The Lexies_ featured Eric and released an EP _Do You Want Some Money?_ in 2007, which has likely been lost.

### Love Migrate  
Formerly known as _Goodnight Owl_, _Love Migrate_ were a borderline Ambient Indie Rock band featuring Eric on Drums, Joey on guitar and various electronic instruments, with Edward Alexander, Bella Walker, Casey Hartnett, Monty Hartnett, Pete Sismanes, and Glen Smith filling out an array of other roles. _Love Migrate_ had the distinction of continuing well into the rise of King Gizzard, and were published by Flightless Records and then Dusky Tracks. Monty Hartnett is further associated with King Gizzard having played drums on _Crying_, and _Pipe-Dream_ from _[Oddments](https://kglw.net/releases/oddments)_. 

### Revolver & Sun  
_Revolver & Sun_ were a sixties inspired Folk Rock band featuring Stu and Cook on guitar and bass, Monty Hartnett on drums and Fraser Gorman with lead vocals. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dSCEPXaTAQ) is a video of them jamming the Blues with 'Dennis', likely the inspiration for Homeless Man In Adidas.

### Your Ailing Girls Heart  
This seems to have been a project of Cook's, little evidence of its existence remains. Two songs were uploaded to a [Myspace page](https://myspace.com/yourailinggirlsheart) which are now lost due to a [botched server migration](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/myspace-apparently-lost-12-years-worth-of-music-and-almost-no-one-noticed/).

### SUB-Humans  
Formerly known as _Trumpdisco_, this was an electronic production and DJ duo consisting of Joey and Alexander Braithwaite, since Joey's apparant departure in 2016 the project has continued under the name _SUB-humans_.

### Buried Horses

## Associated Music Projects

### Leah Senior  
_Leah Senior_ is a solo Folk artist and as the 'Reticent Raconteur' narrating on _[Murder Of The Universe](https://kglw.net/releases/murder-of-the-universe)_, and _[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/releases/polygondwanaland)_, is one of the most prolific musical contributors to King Gizzard outside the core members. Leah is a personal friend of the band members and former label-mate at Flightless Records, where King Gizzard members have contributed technical roles in the production of her albums.

### Mild High Club  
_Mild High Club_ is the hypnagogic-psych project of Alex Brettin, and collaborator on [_Sketches Of Brunswick East_].

### Traffik Island

### Tropical Fuck Storm
_Tropical Fuck Storm_ is the latest Art Punk project from legendary Australian music couple Gareth Liddiard and Fiona Kitschin, formerly of _[The Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drones_(Australian_band)_, featuring Lauren Hammel and Erica Dunn. Gareth was an early supporter of King Gizzard, who had them open for _The Drones_ and has a song named after him on _[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/releases/12-bar-bruise)_. Since the launch of the new project, it was time to return the favour and publish it on Flightless Records, eventuating in King Gizz travelling to Gareth and Fiona's rural Victoria home studio to record [Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies) ([behind the scenes documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs)), where they also recorded what would become their _[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/releases/satanic-slumber-party)_ collaboration.

## Influences  
King Gizzard make music in a vast array of styles and frequently draw from musicians of generations past.

### Hawkwind  
_Hawkwind_ are likely the band most covered by King Gizzard, though only for one verse frequently inserted into _Robot Stop_. The visual style of King Gizzard is also often reminiscent of _Hawkwind_'s iconography.

### Frank Zappa  

### Motörhead  
Cavs is a particular fan of _Motörhead_, taking many opportunities to represent them and having paid respects to Lemmy. They are know for their distinct bass drum double kick sound that Cavs often emulates.

## Influencees  
In time, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard will become a point of reference for generations of future musicians. Now after more than a decade since their debut, this process is just now beginning to be expressed in newer bands.

### Psychedelic Porn Crumpets  
Psychedelic Porn Crumpets blur the line between being contemporaries of King Gizzard and Tame Impala rather than the next generation, but their being several years younger as a band is clear. Tending to go for a cleaner guitar sound, they effortlessly match the energy of King Gizzard's _[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/releases/nonagon-infinity)_ and have strongly established themselves as a psychedelic drenched raging party band.

### Liminal  
_Liminal_ are a Psych Rock band from Lismore, New South Wales, who are developing a distinct King Gizzard flavoured sound but with space enough for their own personality too. Principal member Alako Myles can be seen wearing a King Gizzard shirt in their music video for [Ettarath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44iDsMeL_pk). They released their debut album, _Place_, in 2021.

### The Lazy Eyes  
_The Lazy Eyes_ are a Sydney, New South Wales based Psych Rock band who released their debut album, _Songbook_, in 2022. Wearing their influences on their sleeve, several tracks on the album nod to other Psych Rock projects by using their sounds, such as _The Seaside_ with _Innerspeaker_-era Tame Impala guitar tones, hints of _ORB_ on their breakout single _Fuzz Jam_, and of course the Kraut-Gizz inspired _Where's My Brain???_. 

### Battlesnake  
Significantly heavier and looser than King Gizzard, they use a similar 'all-in' approach creating the appearance of a drastic mythology that is little but post-King Gizzard. This is best demonstrated by their music video for _[I Am The Vomit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WwdhX6E2NY)_.
