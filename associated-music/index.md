During the formative years of the band it would have been accurate to describe King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard as everyone's side project; now, they are the nexus for a range of solo and side acts, peers, collaborators, and even a new generation of bands who draw from their influence.

## Music Projects of King Gizzard Band Members

Stu is the only member of King Gizzard not actively involved with composing music in other bands or solo projects (he does technical duties for some of these though):

### The Murlocs  
The Murlocs is a Garage/Blues Rock band fronted by Ambrose, featuring Cook on bass, with Cal Shortal, Tim Karmouche, and Matt Blach playing guitar keyboards and drums respectively. Formed around the same time as King Gizzard, they have maintained a very respectable output between the many album releases and tours of their bigger and weirder counterpart. Their material is a more straightforward reflection of whatever Ambrose was contributing to King Gizzard at the time, and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of his idiosyncratic voice and signature harmonica wail.

### Pipe-Eye  
This is the solo project of Cook, who began releasing music under the title in 2015. He typically writes and records all the music alone in his bedroom except drums, which are typically played by Cavs and recorded at King Gizzard headquarters. The music provides an insight into the existence of Cook Craig, who populates his songs with seemingly mundane topics delivered in a highly idiosyncratic, kooky style that will be recognisable to fans of the handful of King Gizzard songs he has written and recorded vocals for.

### Bullant  
Bullant is the solo techno/IDM production project of Joey. His debut album _Tyson, Crying_ shows the learning process of Ableton in real time, unable to save a project using the free version of the software, each song was completed in a single session under the stairs at the studio. Beginning in 2019, one could infer that this project was the offshoot of the electronic experiments of King Gizzard such as can be heard at the end of [_Fishing For Fishies_](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies), or in [_Made In Timeland_](https://kglw.net/releases/made-in-timeland).

### CAVS
In 2021, Cavs released his debut solo self-titled drumming album. A pure expression of his drumming ability, [_CAVS_](https://www.discogs.com/master/2280727-Cavs-Cavs) shows off chops in various percussive styles outside of what he usually gets to play with King Gizzard.

### Heavy Moss  
Still yet to debut, Heavy Moss is a band fronted by Lucas. Since the dissolution of his independent record label _Dusky Tracks_, Lucas has started a new project to develop his musical composition ability, even getting piano lessons for the purpose.

## Prior and Inactive Projects of King Gizzard Band Members  

Prior to the formation of King Gizzard, each member had already been in an array of bands and musical projects populated with other locals from the Deniliquin, Barwon Heights, Geelong, Angelsea, and Melbourne areas:

### The Houses  
This was a Garage Rock band formed in 2005 featuring Stu on guitar, Cavs drumming, and Lucas on bass and backup vocals. Other members included Blaise Adamson and Tim Richards. They released one EP and the 2008 album [_Uncle Fever + Aunt Ammonia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vaWolGUpro).

### Sambrose Automobile  
This was a Blues Rock band featuring Ambrose and Lucas, also with Sam Cooper, Cal Shortal and Lonnie Carland. They released two EPs and an album, [_Beat Boom Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrfVJicYwuo) in 2009.

### Almacknjack  
Almacknjack was a garage rock band featuring Stu on guitar, Almo Troup with vocals, and Jack Robbins (who went solo as [Forever Son](#forever-son)). In 2008, they released their only album [_Taste of an Orange_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJMCC1Ommms&t=684s).

### The Lexies  
The Lexies featured Eric and released an EP _Do You Want Some Money?_ in 2007, which has likely been lost.

### Love Migrate (formerly Goodnight Owl)  
Love Migrate were a borderline ambient indie-rock band featuring Eric on Drums, Joey on guitar and various electronic instruments, Edward Alexander, Bella Walker, Casey Hartnett, Monty Hartnett, Pete Sismanes, and Glen Smith. Love Migrate had the distinction of continuing well into the formation of King Gizzard, and were published by Flightless Records and then Dusky Tracks.

### Revolver & Sun  
Revolver & Sun were a 60s inspired folk-rock band featuring Stu and Cook on guitar and bass, Monty Hartnett on drums and Fraser Gorman with lead vocals.

### Your Ailing Girls Heart  
This seems to have been a project of Cook's, little evidence of its existence remains. Two songs were uploaded to a [Myspace page](https://myspace.com/yourailinggirlsheart) which are now lost due to a [botched server migration](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/myspace-apparently-lost-12-years-worth-of-music-and-almost-no-one-noticed/).

### Trumpdisco / SUB-Humans
Trumpdisco was an electronic production and DJ duo consisting of Joey and Alexander Braithwaite, since Joey's apparant departure in 2016 the project has continued under the name SUB-humans.

### Buried Horses
Buried Horses were a short-lived band featuring Eric on drums, Jim Westmore, Tom Westmore, Liam O'Shannessy, and Mark Berry. They released an album, _Tempest_, in 2011. 

### Dreamin' Wild
Dreamin' Wild were an easy listening Jazz and Blues rock band featuring Cook on bass, Chris Jennings, Monty Hartnett, Sam Cooper, and Tim Karmouche, and released albums in 2016 and 2019.

## King Gizzard Associated Music Projects  
Members of King Gizzard are associated in various ways with many other musicians, either as collaborators, personal friends, or through contributing to their releases in technical roles.

### Mild High Club
Mild High Club is the hypnagogic-psych project of Alex Brettin, and collaborator on [_Sketches Of Brunswick East_]. The Mild High Club live band had been booked for 2016's Gizzfest, and Alex hit it off so well with King Gizzard that he stuck around for a couple of extra weeks and put down a series of demos that later became the album.
