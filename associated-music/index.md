During the formative years of the band it would have been accurate to describe King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard as everyone's side project; now, they are the nexus for a range of solo and side acts, peers, collaborators, and even a new generation of bands who draw from their influence.

## Music Projects of King Gizzard Band Members

Stu is the only member of King Gizzard not actively involved with composing music in other bands or solo projects (he does technical duties for some of these though):

### The Murlocs  
The Murlocs is a Garage/Blues Rock band fronted by Ambrose, featuring Cook on bass, with Cal Shortal, Tim Karmouche, and Matt Blach playing guitar keyboards and drums respectively. Formed around the same time as King Gizzard, they have maintained a very respectable output between the many album releases and tours of their bigger and weirder counterpart. Their material is a more straightforward reflection of whatever Ambrose was contributing to King Gizzard at the time, and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of his idiosyncratic voice and signature harmonica wail.

### Pipe-Eye  
This is the solo project of Cook, who began releasing music under the title in 2015. He typically writes and records all the music alone in his bedroom except drums, which are typically played by Cavs and recorded at King Gizzard headquarters. The music provides an insight into the existence of Cook Craig, who populates his songs with seemingly mundane topics delivered in a highly idiosyncratic, kooky style that will be recognisable to fans of the handful of King Gizzard songs he has written and recorded vocals for.

### Bullant  
Bullant is the solo techno/IDM production project of Joey. His debut album _Tyson, Crying_ shows the learning process of Ableton in real time, unable to save a project using the free version of the software, each song was completed in a single session under the stairs at the studio. Beginning in 2019, one could infer that this project was the offshoot of the electronic experiments of King Gizzard such as can be heard at the end of [_Fishing For Fishies_](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies), or in [_Made In Timeland_](https://kglw.net/releases/made-in-timeland).

### CAVS
In 2021, Cavs released his debut solo self-titled drumming album. A pure expression of his drumming ability, [_CAVS_](https://www.discogs.com/master/2280727-Cavs-Cavs) shows off chops in various percussive styles outside of what he usually gets to play with King Gizzard.

### Heavy Moss  
Still yet to debut, Heavy Moss is a band fronted by Lucas. Since the dissolution of his independent record label _Dusky Tracks_, Lucas has started a new project to develop his musical composition ability, even getting piano lessons for the purpose.

## Prior and Inactive Projects of King Gizzard Band Members  

Prior to the formation of King Gizzard, each member had already been in an array of bands and musical projects populated with other locals from the Deniliquin, Barwon Heights, Geelong, Angelsea, and Melbourne areas:

### The Houses  
This was a Garage Rock band formed in 2005 featuring Stu on guitar, Cavs drumming, and Lucas on bass and backup vocals. Other members included Blaise Adamson and Tim Richards. They released one EP and the 2008 album [_Uncle Fever + Aunt Ammonia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vaWolGUpro).

### Sambrose Automobile  
This was a Blues Rock band featuring Ambrose and Lucas, also with Sam Cooper, Cal Shortal and Lonnie Carland. They released two EPs and an album, [_Beat Boom Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrfVJicYwuo) in 2009.

### Almacknjack  
Almacknjack was a garage rock band featuring Stu on guitar, Almo Troup with vocals, and Jack Robbins (who went on to make music as [Forever Son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J76WBb6XW0)). In 2008, they released their only album [_Taste of an Orange_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJMCC1Ommms&t=684s).

### The Lexies  
The Lexies featured Eric and released an EP _Do You Want Some Money?_ in 2007, which has likely been lost.

### Goodnight Owl / Love Migrate

### Revolver & Sun

### Your Ailing Girls Heart  
This seems to have been a project of Cook's, little evidence of its existence remains. Two songs were uploaded to a [Myspace page](https://myspace.com/yourailinggirlsheart) which are now lost due to a [botched server migration](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/myspace-apparently-lost-12-years-worth-of-music-and-almost-no-one-noticed/).

### Trumpdisco / Sub Humans

### Buried Horses
