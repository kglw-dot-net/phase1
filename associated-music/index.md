During the formative years of the band it would have been accurate to describe King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard as everyone's side project; now, they are the nexus for a range of solo and side acts, peers, collaborators, and even a new generation of bands who draw from their influence.

## Other Music Projects  
Stu is the only member of King Gizzard not actively involved with composing music in other bands or solo projects, tending to focus on only one band at a time while the rest spread out their compositional work.

### The Murlocs  
The Murlocs is a Garage/Blues Rock band fronted by Ambrose, featuring Cook on bass, with Cal Shortal, Tim Karmouche, and Matt Blach playing guitar, keyboards, and drums respectively. Formed around the same time as King Gizzard, they have maintained a very respectable output between the many album releases and tours of their bigger and weirder counterpart. Their material is a more straightforward reflection of whatever Ambrose was contributing to King Gizzard at the time, and is guaranteed to be enjoyed by any fan of his idiosyncratic voice and signature harmonica wail.

### Pipe-Eye  
This is the solo project of Cook, who began releasing music under the title in 2015. He typically writes and records all the music alone in his bedroom except drums, which are typically played by Cavs and recorded at King Gizzard headquarters. The music provides an insight into the existence of Cookie, who populates his songs with seemingly mundane topics delivered in a highly idiosyncratic, kooky style that will be recognisable to fans of the handful of King Gizzard songs he has written and recorded vocals for.

### Bullant  
Bullant is the solo Techno/IDM production project of Joey. His debut album _Tyson, Crying_ shows the learning process of Ableton in real time, unable to save a project using the free version of the software, each song was completed in a single session under the stairs at the studio. Beginning in 2019, one could infer that this project was the offshoot of the electronic experiments of King Gizzard such as can be heard at the end of [_Fishing For Fishies_](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies), or in [_Made In Timeland_](https://kglw.net/releases/made-in-timeland).

### CAVS  
In 2021, Cavs released his debut solo self-titled drumming album. A pure expression of his drumming ability, [_CAVS_](https://www.discogs.com/master/2280727-Cavs-Cavs) shows off chops in various percussive styles outside of what he usually gets to play with King Gizzard.

### Heavy Moss  
Still yet to debut, Heavy Moss is a band fronted by Lucas. Since the dissolution of his independent record label _Dusky Tracks_, Lucas has started a new project to develop his musical composition ability, even getting piano lessons for the purpose.

## Prior and Inactive Projects  
Prior to the formation of King Gizzard, each member had already been in an array of bands and musical projects populated with other locals from the Deniliquin, Barwon Heights, Geelong, Angelsea, and Melbourne areas but have since become focused on King Gizzard.

### The Houses  
This was a Garage Rock band formed in 2005 featuring Stu on guitar, Cavs drumming, and Lucas on bass and backup vocals. Other members included Blaise Adamson and Tim Richards. They released one EP and the 2008 album [_Uncle Fever + Aunt Ammonia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vaWolGUpro).

### Sambrose Automobile  
This was a precursor to The Murlocs, a Blues Rock band featuring Ambrose and Lucas, also with Sam Cooper, Cal Shortal and Lonnie Carland. They released two EPs and an album, [_Beat Boom Soul_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrfVJicYwuo) in 2009.

### Almacknjack  
Almacknjack was a Garage Rock band featuring Stu on guitar, Almo Troup with vocals, and Jack Robbins (who went solo as [Forever Son](#forever-son)). In 2008, they released their only album [_Taste of an Orange_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJMCC1Ommms&t=684s).

### The Lexies  
The Lexies featured Eric and released an EP _Do You Want Some Money?_ in 2007, which has likely been lost.

### Love Migrate  
Formerly known as Goodnight Owl, Love Migrate were a borderline Ambient Indie Rock band featuring Eric on Drums, Joey on guitar and various electronic instruments, with Edward Alexander, Bella Walker, Casey Hartnett, Monty Hartnett, Pete Sismanes, and Glen Smith filling out an array of other roles. Love Migrate had the distinction of continuing well into the formation of King Gizzard, and were published by Flightless Records and then Dusky Tracks. Monty Hartnett is further associated with King Gizzard having played drums on _Crying_, and _Pipe-Dream_ from _[Oddments](https://kglw.net/releases/oddments)_. 

### Revolver & Sun  
Revolver & Sun were a sixties inspired Folk Rock band featuring Stu and Cook on guitar and bass, Monty Hartnett on drums and Fraser Gorman with lead vocals. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dSCEPXaTAQ) is a video of them jamming the Blues with 'Dennis', likely the inspiration for Homeless Man In Adidas.

### Your Ailing Girls Heart  
This seems to have been a project of Cook's, little evidence of its existence remains. Two songs were uploaded to a [Myspace page](https://myspace.com/yourailinggirlsheart) which are now lost due to a [botched server migration](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/myspace-apparently-lost-12-years-worth-of-music-and-almost-no-one-noticed/).

### SUB-Humans  
Formerly known as Trumpdisco, this was an electronic production and DJ duo consisting of Joey and Alexander Braithwaite, since Joey's apparant departure in 2016 the project has continued under the name SUB-humans.

### Buried Horses  
Buried Horses were a band featuring Eric on drums, Jim Westmore, Tom Westmore, Liam O'Shannessy, and Mark Berry. They released an album, _Tempest_, in 2011. 

### Dreamin' Wild  
Dreamin' Wild were an easy listening Jazz and Blues rock band featuring Cook on bass, Chris Jennings, Monty Hartnett, Sam Cooper, and Tim Karmouche, and released albums in 2016 and 2019.

## Associated Music Projects  
Members of King Gizzard are associated in various ways with many other musicians, either as collaborators, personal friends, or through contributing to their releases in technical roles.

### Leah Senior  
Leah Senior is a solo Folk artist and as the 'Reticent Raconteur' narrating on _[Murder Of The Universe](https://kglw.net/releases/murder-of-the-universe)_, and _[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/releases/polygondwanaland)_, is one of the most prolific musical contributors to King Gizzard outside the core members. Leah is a personal friend of the band members and former label-mate at Flightless Records, where King Gizzard members have contributed technical roles in the production of her albums.

### Mild High Club  
Mild High Club is the hypnagogic-psych project of Alex Brettin, and collaborator on [_Sketches Of Brunswick East_]. The Mild High Club live band had been booked for 2016's Gizzfest, and Alex hit it off so well with King Gizzard that he stuck around for a couple of extra weeks and put down a series of demos that later became the album.

### ORB  
ORB are a Melbourne based heavy Psych Rock band led by Zak Olsen, and featuring Daff Gravolin and Jamie Harmer. Stu ocasionally records, mixes or contributes keyboards to their music, and the band have supported and toured several times with King Gizzard. Zak is part of a network of mutual friends in the Melbourne music scene associated with King Gizzard, including Leah Senior who at one stage was his house-mate.

### Traffik Island  
Traffik Island is the solo project of Zak Olsen from ORB. Alternating between Syd Barrett-style zany acoustic Psych Folk, and Plunderphonics dance music, this is a carefree project for Zak to express himself and collaborate with other Flightless Records artists.

### Stonefield  
Stonefield is a Heavy Psych quartet of sisters: Amy, Hannah, Sarah, and Holly Findlay. They are signed to Flightless Records and have toured with King Gizzard. Though uncredited, Amy plays drums on Persistence from _[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/releases/omnium-gatherium)_, and is Cavs' spouse.

### Amyl and the Sniffers  
Amyl and the Sniffers were the Flightless Records label-mate of King Gizzard while they went through their own meteroic rise. They are a frequent collaborator with King Gizzard friend [John Angus Stewart](https://kglw.net/band-bio#john-angus-stewart).

### Tropical Fuck Storm
Tropical Fuck Storm is the latest Art Punk project from legendary Australian music couple Gareth Liddiard and Fiona Kitschin, formerly of _[The Drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drones_(Australian_band)_, featuring Lauren Hammel and Erica Dunn. Gareth was an early supporter of King Gizzard, who opened for _The Drones_ and has a song named after him on _[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/releases/12-bar-bruise)_. Since the launch of the new project, it was time to return the favour and publish it on Flightless Records, eventuating in King Gizz travelling to Gareth and Fiona's rural Victoria home studio to record [Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/releases/fishing-for-fishies) ([behind the scenes documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs)), where they also recorded what would become their _[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/releases/satanic-slumber-party)_ collaboration.
