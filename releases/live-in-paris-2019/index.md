Recorded live at [L’Olympia, Paris, France, October 14, 2019](/setlists/2019/10/14/lolympia-bruno-coquatrix-paris-france.html). Released during an Australian bush fire crisis, 100% of proceeds from [Bandcamp sales](https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-paris-19) are donated to [Wildlife Victoria](https://www.wildlifevictoria.org.au/). The band were promoting [Infest The Rats' Nest](../infest-the-rats-nest), and recording material for [Chunky Shrapnel](../chunky-shrapnel) through this tour – but leading up to the original planned marathon jam shows of 2020 the set-lists tended to be notably diverse, including throwbacks, rarities and alternate versions of fan favourites. For this performance, these include: Crumbling Castle and The Fourth Colour ([Polygondwanaland](../polygondwanaland)), Muddy Water ([Gumboot Soup](../gumboot-soup)) and an extended jam version of Am I In Heaven? ([I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz)).
