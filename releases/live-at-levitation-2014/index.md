Recorded live at [Carson Creek Ranch, Austin, Texas, USA, May 2nd 2014](/setlists/2014/05/02/carson-creek-ranch-austin-tx). This was the first full live show that KGLW played in the United States, at the psychedelic rock festival Levitation.

Promoting [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz) at the time, the set list consists mostly of that album, including the rare b-side _Wholly Ghost_ (this is the only digital publication of that song), and concluding with Head On – Pill ([Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](../float-along-fill-your-lungs)).
