Recorded live at Carson Creek Ranch, Austin, Texas, USA, May 2nd 2014. This was the first full live show that KGATLW played in the United States, at the psychedelic rock festival Levitation.

Promoting [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz) at the time, the set list consists mostly of that album, including the rare b-side _Wholly Ghost_ (this is the only digital publication of that song), and concluding with Head On – Pill ([Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](../float-along-fill-your-lungs)).
