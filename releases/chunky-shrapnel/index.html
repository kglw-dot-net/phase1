<p>KGATLW tried to record many live albums over the years, experimenting and waiting until they knew they could go big and get it right the first time. Chunky Shrapnel is the result, chronicling their whole 2019 Europe tour, with highlight moments from each show connected by a few original ‘intermission’ ambient songs.</p>
<p>Though Chunky Shrapnel is more than the album, the tour was captured on analogue film by John Angus Stewart of PHC Films, who had recently become the first visual artist other than Jason Galea to work with the group, producing a set of music videos for <a href="/releases/infest-the-rats-nest">Infest The Rat’s Nest</a>. This footage arrived as the concert film of the same title, with the album as a soundtrack to accompany behind the scenes moments as well as the performances.</p>
<p>Other visual work includes Chunky, a high quality photo book shot by Jamie Wdziekonski, a regular photographer of the band with an instantly recognisable grainy black and white style.</p>
<p>Lastly, this tour was the genesis of Jason’s meticulously drawn, limited screen printed posters, now highly collectable, these distinct prints give a unique visual flavour for every show and round out the content of a live album like few others.</p>
