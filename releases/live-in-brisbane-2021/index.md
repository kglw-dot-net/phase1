Recorded live at [The Princess Theatre, Meeanjin (Brisbane), December 19th 2021](/setlists/2021/12/19/the-princess-theatre-brisbane-australia). Each track from this release was uploaded to Youtube by the band, [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcIIEsozEvCSBYMVnGZsEbm31JfsKc2r) is a correctly sequenced playlist. This tour consisted of five night residencies in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Hobart, and Adelaide, with Brisbane to be the final stop. The set-list for each night had a different theme, which for this recording (night one) was ‘Acoustic’. ‘Jams’, ‘Microtonal’, ‘Garage’, and ‘Metal’ were the four other themes.

Courtesy of the theme, the set-list contains a selection too unique to give highlights – consisting of their chillest and grooviest songs, the vibes are high and the toned down, ‘unplugged’ style instrument suite gives these songs rare justice after years of frenetic live shows.
