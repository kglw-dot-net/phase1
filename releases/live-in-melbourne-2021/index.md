Recorded live at [Summer Sound Festival, Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Naarm (Melbourne), Australia, February 26, 2021](/setlists/2021/02/26/sidney-myer-music-bowl-melbourne-australia.html). This release was also made [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X_LVeLFrA8) by the band with concert footage. Opening with a rare solo drumming track titled ‘Fury’, the performance occurred between the releases of companion albums [K.G.](../kg) and [L.W.](../lw) with both heavily featured. Several live staples from [Flying Microtonal Banana](../flying-microtonal-banana) are also included to round out this entirely microtonal set-list.
