During the recording of [Fishing For Fishies](../fishing-for-fishies), at inspiration and friend of the band Gareth Liddiard’s rural Victoria home studio, the crew all ended the sessions with a loose, noisy jam. Also known as the Hat Jam (they were all wearing hats), this recording sat dormant and was only hinted at by a snippet in the making-of video: [How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs). Fans wondered for years if the recording would ever see true publication, and after questioning the band about it in a Reddit AMA, it was eventually sanctioned to be fleshed out and completed by Gareth’s project Tropical Fuck Storm and released as a collaboration.
