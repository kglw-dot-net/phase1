Recorded on [25 May 2016 at The Independent](../setlists/2016/05/25/the-independent-san-francisco-ca.html). With confidence gained releasing [their first live album](../chunky-shrapnel), the band were seemingly ready to revisit a prior recording and finally do it justice in publication. Joining the ranks of Joe Satriani and Thee Oh Sees with a career defining moment captured in (and titled after) the mecca of Psychedelic Rock, this classic style live album predominantly features key tracks from [Nonagon Infinity](../nonagon-infinity), which they were touring in support of, interpolating moments from its predecessor [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz), and culminates in fan favourite jams from [Quarters!](../quarters) and [Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](../float-along-fill-your-lungs); likely the first time these songs were properly captured in extended format for the sake of a live show, now a common practise.
