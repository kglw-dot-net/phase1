The first true psychedelic album. A lo-fi throwback in sound to The Beatles’ Indian influenced era, thanks to the extensive use of a Sitar. This instrument was chosen as the first in a project to learn a new instrument every year, also marking the beginning of a discography wide fascination with sounds from ‘the East’.

What to listen to next:

*   [If you want a bit more Rock in your Psych-Rock](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz)
