Oddments is a loose collection of lo-fi psych songs that were created outside of other whole album projects or for abandoned concepts. Representing several paths that the band never went down, these are some of the most unique KGATLW songs that tie up the loose ends of their early period for bigger and better sounding projects.

The first opus of Jason Galea, this intricate artwork spreads over the triple gatefold of the first vinyl issue with its own little world of idiosyncratic characters.
