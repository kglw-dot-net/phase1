Recorded live at [New Belgium Brewing Company, Asheville, NC, USA, September 1st 2019](/setlists/2019/09/01/new-belgium-brewing-company-asheville-nc). The band were promoting [Infest The Rats Nest](../infest-the-rats-nest), and recording material for [Chunky Shrapnel](../chunky-shrapnel) through this tour – but leading up to the original planned marathon jam shows of 2020 the set-lists tended to be notably diverse, including throwbacks, rarities and alternate versions of fan favourites. For this performance, these include: Alter Me III and Altered Beast IV ([Murder Of The Universe](../murder-of-the-universe)), Beginner’s Luck ([Gumboot Soup](../gumboot-soup)), and a 13+ minute finale of The Bitter Boogie ([Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](../paper-mache-dream-balloon)).
