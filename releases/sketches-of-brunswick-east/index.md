The first real stab at Jazz, its title is an homage to Miles Davis’ [_Sketches of Spain_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain). However, rather than channel Davis or any kind of more familiar fusion, the only ‘real’ jazz influence in the music actually comes with tinges of Funk from Ethiopia.

A collaborative album with Hypnagogic-psych-pop act [Mild High Club](https://www.stonesthrow.com/artist/mildhighclub/), who played the 2016 iteration of the band’s now defunct showcase festival, Gizzfest. Alex Brettin (of MHC) stuck around for a couple of weeks, and naturally some voice memo ‘sketches’ of songs materialised. With the sketches later completed by the band, the album retains the laid-back stoner fingerprints of MHC, tied together by the KGATLW signature ‘took too much’ weirdness.
