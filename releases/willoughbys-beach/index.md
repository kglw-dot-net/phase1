The precursor to debut album [12 Bar Bruise](../12-bar-bruise), this EP is an even rougher blend of Surf-Punk with little of the psychedelic elements KGLW would become known for. Named after a beach local to some of the group members, it shows the roots of the group’s formation as an underground party band.
