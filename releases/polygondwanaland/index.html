We're gonna get there<br />
Polygondwanaland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bias warning: This is the author’s favourite KGATLW album.</p>
<p>Polygondwanaland is hard to deny as the masterwork of the group, developed for at least three years, this extra care clearly shows in the end product. Clean, meticulous, proggy and mathy, the primary ‘gimmick’ is that the album is composed entirely in a dizzying array of polymeters and polyrythms (simply put, each musical voice plays in a different time signature).</p>
<p>This psychedelic folklore voyage both expands and deepens the Gizzverse in a multi-act structure that uses subtle spoken word narration to explore the vast sands of time.</p>
<p>Such a special album was deemed to get a special release, so as a gift to the fans, was given away for free; not just free as in ‘free beer’, but completely free of copyright under a creative commons attribution license, meaning anyone could (and still can!) create and sell their own edition of the album using the raw master files and art assets made available. At the time of writing, over 300 different editions are available on at least 15 formats (Including reel-to-reel, minidisc, floppy disc, and just about every existing size and type of vinyl record). Several record labels now exist that were established or launched just to publish this album that will forever hold a special place in the heart of many KGATLW fans.</p>
<p>What to listen to next:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/releases/infest-the-rats-nest">If you want the next Gizzverse album (technical and heavy)</a></li>
<li><a href="/releases/murder-of-the-universe">If you want another strongly narrative driven multi-act album</a></li>
<li><a href="/releases/butterfly-3000">If you want more simple rhythmic interplay between synths and the band</a></li>
<li><a href="/releases/paper-mache-dream-balloon">If you liked the hints of folk and want more of just that</a></li>
<li><a href="/releases/im-in-your-mind-fuzz">If this was too ‘deep’ and you want to hear more of what led up to it</a></li>
</ul>
