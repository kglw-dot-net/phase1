{:class="lyrics"}

This truly unique Spaghetti Western soundtrack uses spoken narration rather than sung lyrics. It is a collaboration with Broderick Smith who wrote and narrated the story, and is the father of band member Ambrose.

*   [If you want some more soundtrack style songs](../oddments)
*   [If you want to hear the one other song that sounds like this](../12-bar-bruise)
