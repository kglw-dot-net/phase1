The debut album. Surfy, lo-fi, and slightly trippy Garage Rock. This album was partially recorded on iPhones and serves as a means to an end, delineating all looser prior material and establishing KGLW as a fully functioning band.

Distribution necessitated the founding of Flightless Records, the independent label that published all the work of the group for nearly a decade.

The album cover was the first by Jason Galea, now considered a member of the group, who as well as creating most of the other visual work of the band, has designed every cover since.

> Firstly, thank you so much for buying this record or slipping it on your turntable or listening to my ramblings. It would have been hilarious and 
> unfathomable to my 21 year old self that anyone beyond our immediate group of friends and a few garage rock nerds would care in the slightest! In fact I don't 
> really remember much of making this record. I think we just wanted to make it weird. And loud. And kinda dumb. Between 19 and 23 years old, nervous and 
> confused, wide eyed, living off goon bags, ciggies, doritos and the dole. Paul Maybury engineered and really guided us through this one. He let me take control of 
> the faders and experiment with his seemingly endless array of recording equipment. I pretended I knew what I was doing. Anyway, he pulled it all together - 
> I shudder to think what it would have sounded like without his road hardened wisdom. Many firsts here- first collaborations and early narrative based music with 
> Brod Smith which would lead to making eyes like the sky with him a few months later. More firsts-like working with Jason Galea. Ambrose knew Jase from 
> skateboarding circles and we found his drawing of a royal looking lizard beast-thing stabbing some teddy bear-ish monster. Seemed perfect. He's become part 
> of the furniture and we've worked with him on everything since. Formative years? I think it was that time of your life where you start using  your brain for 
> the first time in general. Lizard brain. Who am I? Who was me?  
> Enjoy! Love Stu
