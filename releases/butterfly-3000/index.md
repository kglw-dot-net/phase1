The most positive, uplifting album and first to be composed entirely in major scales. The band accompanies programmed synths through a trippy odyssey, looking far into the future and exploring themes of metamorphosis with newfound confidence inspired by fatherhood.

Butterfly 3000 is the first to get a completed accompanying visual album, where each track has a music video. This was attempted for [Nonagon Infinity](../nonagon-infinity), but the project was abandoned by the band's primary visual collaborator Jason Galea in order to keep up with the flurry of albums proceeding that release. This time a diverse spread of friends and new collaborators were commissioned, producing a remarkable body of visual work and appealing to new demographics.
