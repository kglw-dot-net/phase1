Recorded live at Alexandra Palace, London, England, October 5th 2019 and released December 24th 2020, the 10,000 capacity venue hosted KGATLW’s biggest ever live show at the time. The band were promoting [Infest The Rats Nest](./infest-the-rats-nest), and recording material for [Chunky Shrapnel](./chunky-shrapnel) through this tour, the set-list for this landmark show is full of heavy staples and concludes with a shortened 10 minute version of Float Along — Fill Your Lungs ([Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](./float-along-fill-your-lungs)). Compared with the other 2019 live albums it has notably higher audio quality with well mixed crowd sounds.
