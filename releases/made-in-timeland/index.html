<p>Smoke and mirrors disappearing when you're near us<br />

<p>Made in Timeland was cursed. Recorded some time during 2019, it was created as interlude music for the original marathon live shows planned for 2020. The material was shelved, presumably until it would be able to serve its original purpose; but as this prospect dragged out over the course of the pandemic, the band hoped instead to debut it at smaller local shows. Inevitably, these shows would be cancelled too, as the local live music scene struggled to get back on its feet.</p>
<p>The myth of Timeland grew, as hints of its existence from the band grew to outlandish proportions (helped by some uncharacteristic trolling from members of the group) and it’s nature of cursing any show it was meant to be heard at was realised. Was it just an unreleased album? It seemed clear that it wouldn’t sound like a typical release.</p>
<p>Ultimately, some of the shelved vinyl copies meant as a free gift for attendees made it out into the world in early 2022 available in obscure independent record stores, and small allocations available online later on. It eventually received official digital-streaming publication upon completion of the marathon shows it was originally intended for, where its ‘spiritual successor’, Laminated Denim, was used as interlude music instead.</p>
<p>MIT is a deep, trance-like exploration into Techno and IDM production, and oddly contains the first real foray into vocal rapping by ‘Shrimpomaniac’ the alter-ego of Ambrose.</p>
