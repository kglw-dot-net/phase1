Made in Timeland was cursed. Recorded some time during 2019, it was created as interlude music for the original marathon live shows planned for 2020. The material was shelved, presumably until it would be able to serve its original purpose; but as this prospect dragged out over the course of the pandemic, the band hoped instead to debut it at smaller local shows. Inevitably, these shows would be cancelled too, as the local live music scene struggled to get back on its feet.

The myth of Timeland grew, as hints of its existence from the band grew to outlandish proportions (helped by some uncharacteristic trolling from members of the group) and it’s nature of cursing any show it was meant to be heard at was realised. Was it just an unreleased album? It seemed clear that it wouldn’t sound like a typical release.

Ultimately, it was unveiled at the [Return of the Curse of Timeland show at the Reunion Park, Melbourne](https://kglw.net/setlists/2022/03/05/reunion-park-melbourne-city-centre-australia.html) on March 5th 2022. Some of the shelved vinyl copies were made available at the show, and shortly after in several obscure independent record stores around the world, with allocations available online later on. It eventually received official digital-streaming publication in October upon completion of the marathon shows it was originally intended for, where its ‘spiritual successor’, _Laminated Denim_, was used as interlude music instead.

MIT is a deep, trance-like exploration into Techno and IDM production, and oddly contains the first real foray into vocal rapping by ‘Shrimpomaniac’, the alter-ego of Ambrose.
