Volume 1 of ‘Explorations into Microtonal Tuning’. Named after a custom yellow [Flying V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Flying_V) gifted to [Stu](https://kglw.net/band-bio) by a luthier friend, who made the instrument with a banana shaped head stock and custom fret board including extra frets for microtonal scales based on the [Bağlama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%C4%9Flama). This Turkish folk instrument was the fourth (and would be the last) chosen in a project to learn a new instrument every year.

Now with a more familiar platform, a half complete Bağlama based folk album was scrapped, and the band customised their own set of instruments to accompany the microtones of the flying microtonal banana. This Anatolian sound shines through another psychedelic [Krautrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock) inspired album that instantly became a fan favourite with its theme of cosmic-horror environmentalism.

NOTHING is sacred in our western music.
Over hundreds of years our music de-evolved to featuer less emphasis on rhythm and more attention to harmonic IMPERFECTION.

Our ancestors endeavoured to create a system based on perfect 5ths yet we end up with a series of severely out of tune 3rds and wonky harmonies.
Bach composed in something closer to JUST intonation.

Modern pianos are tuned SHARP at the top and FLAT at the bottom. 
Violinists INSTINCTUALLY bow perfect harmonies in orchestral arrangements.

Barbershop quartets INSTINCTUALLY sing perfect harmonic 3rds and 7ths.
They are right. We are wrong. TRUST your instincts.

We continually dumbed down the rhythmic complexity in favour of harmonic ENTANGLEMENT.
Harmonies that are OUT OF TUNE. 
Nothing is sacred!
And neither is this album.
24-TET EVERYBODY.
Wronger than wrong.
