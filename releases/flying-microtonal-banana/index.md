Volume 1 of ‘Explorations into Microtonal Tuning’. Named after a custom yellow Flying V gifted to the band leader by a guitar maker friend, the instrument was made with a banana shaped head stock and custom fret board that included extra frets for microtonal scales based on the Bağlama. This Turkish folk instrument was the fourth (and would be the last) chosen in a project to learn a new instrument every year.

Now with a more familiar platform, a half complete Bağlama based folk album was scrapped, and the band customised their own set of instruments to accompany the microtones of the flying-microtonal-banana. This Anatolian sound shines through another psychedelic Krautrock inspired album that instantly became a fan favourite with its theme of cosmic-horror environmentalism.
