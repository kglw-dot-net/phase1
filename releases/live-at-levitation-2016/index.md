Recorded live at [Carson Creek Ranch, Austin, Texas, USA, May 1st 2016](/setlists/2016/05/01/barracuda-austin-tx). This is the return of KGLW to psychedelic rock festival Levitation (née Austin Psych Fest). They were building up to the release of [Nonagon Infinity](../nonagon-infinity) at the time, playing songs from that album mixed with its predecessor [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](../im-in-your-mind-fuzz), featuring live staple The River ([Quarters!](../quarters)) and concluding with a rare version of Cut Throat Boogie ([12 Bar Bruise](../12-bar-bruise))
