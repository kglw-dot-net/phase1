This is the searing culmination after years of fan speculation if KGTLW would ever produce a pure-blooded Metal album. Thrash was the perfect experiment for each member to push their technical abilities further, with some familiar undertones of nerdy Stoner-Metal and classic Hard-Rock.

With a Satanic environmental apocalypse narrative – this is the mission that jettisoned the Gizzverse away from a decayed, spent Earth.
