The band is based in Melbourne, Australia, and gradually formed in 2010 out of a group of friends mostly fresh out of high school.

In rough order of studio contribution, here are the members:

**Stu Mackenzie** – The ‘front’ of the band, lead songwriter, lead vocalist, and steers the creative direction of the group either with album concepts, or the constant evolution of songwriting and instrumentation.

**Joey Walker** – The primary of three guitarists, with the odd lead vocal+songwriting credit and performs technical duties. Has the solo project _Bullant_, as an ambient techno/IDM producer, this work occasionally bleeds into KGATLW.

**Ambrose Kenny-Smith** – Occupies a ‘spotlight’ role and provides the group’s signature harmonica wail and live percussion duties. Has the second most vocal and co-writing credits. Is also the lead member of [The Murlocs](The-Murlocs), a garage/blues rock band.

**cook craig** – the third guitarist, cook also contributes the occasional song+lead vocal in his idiosyncratic style. has the solo project _pipe-eye_, as a kooky slice of life singer-songwriter and is also bassist for [the murlocs](The-Murlocs).

**lucas harwood** (formerly skinner) – lucas is the group’s primary bassist, performing in some studio albums and all live shows. he has no compositional credits, with bass written mostly by stu or joey who also usually records bass parts in the absence of lucas.

**michael cavanagh \[cavs\]** – the drummer, composes and performs all primary percussion duties.

**eric moore** (former member) – eric began in the band as the secondary drummer, usually playing live in unison with cavs, and rarely recorded for the studio material. was the founder and director of flightless records, and managed the band up until august 2020 when he departed the group to focus on the label full time.

while stu is the primary contributor and the foundation of studio recordings are usually carried out in a trio with michael and joey, the band maintain a democratic process where any member is able to contribute or veto ideas at any stage of production. this works with an independent, anti-perfectionist approach using the materials and space around them. the band have attended many casual ‘writing retreats’ together where album ideas are born, and often maintain a shared studio/office space where they can go to work. up until the covid-19 pandemic and the departure of eric from the band, this space was the then-current headquarters of flightless records, where other bands on the label would also work, as well as jason galea, the primary visual artist of the group.

Since the split from the band, [Flightless Records](https://flightlessrecords.com/) is now just one branch of an organisation alongside Flightless Distro, a product design/shipping fulfilment facility for the Melbourne record industry, and Flightless Factory, a niche interest record store.
