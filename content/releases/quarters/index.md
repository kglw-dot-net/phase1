This slow, chill, Jazz-Rock album consists of four jams with a duration of 10 minutes and 10 seconds each. It is best known for fan-favourite track ‘The River’, that interpolates Dave Brubeck’s standard Take Five, establishing a fascination with time signatures that use odd numbers of beats.

*   [If you want more loose, jazzy guitar jamming](/releases/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)
