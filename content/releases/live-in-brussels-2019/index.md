Recorded live at Ancienne Belgique, Brussels, Belgium, October 8th and 9th 2019, and released in January 2020 during an Australian bush fire crisis, 100% of proceeds from [Bandcamp sales](https://kinggizzard.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-brussels-19) are donated to [Wires wildlife Rescue](https://www.wires.org.au/). The band were promoting [Infest The Rats Nest](/releases/infest-the-rats-nest), and recording material for [Chunky Shrapnel](/releases/chunky-shrapnel) through this tour – but leading up to the original planned marathon jam shows of 2020 the set-lists tended to be notably diverse, including throwbacks, rarities and alternate versions of fan favourites. For this performance, these include: Sense ([Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](/releases/paper-mache-dream-balloon)), The Wheel and Down The Sink with very rare vocals from Cook ([Gumboot Soup](/releases/gumboot-soup)), and Work This Time ([Oddments](/releases/oddments)).
