The first real stab at Jazz, its title is an homage to Miles Davis’ Sketches Of Spain. However, rather than channel Davis or any kind of more familiar fusion, the only ‘real’ jazz influence in the music actually comes with tinges of Funk from Ethiopia.

A collaborative album with Hypnagogic-psych-pop act [Mild High Club](https://www.stonesthrow.com/artist/mildhighclub/), who played the 2016 iteration of the band’s now defunct showcase festival, Gizzfest. Alex Brettin (Of MHC) stuck around for a couple of weeks, and naturally some voice memo ‘sketches’ of songs materialised. With the sketches later completed by the band, the album retains the laid-back stoner fingerprints of MHC, tied together by the KGATLW signature ‘took too much’ weirdness.

What to listen to next:

*   [If you want more Jazz sounds](/releases/changes)
*   [If you want jazzy, stoner-psych rock](/releases/quarters)
*   [If you want more laid-back, ‘non-Western’ sounding songs](/releases/float-along-fill-your-lungs)
