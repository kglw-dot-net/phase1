Three different songs contain the word ‘boogie’ in this track list, which probably tells you most of what you need to know going in to this Roots-Rock camping album. Very underrated in the discography, this anachronistic gem begs the listener to not take the music so seriously, and likely wont be enjoyed if you aren’t willing to have fun listening to it. This carefree sound is offset by genuine, stark concern for the environment and mental well being in the lyrics.

The strong environmental anti-consumerism theme deserves credit for spurring the realisation of hypocrisy in producing so much waste as a by product of the vinyl record industry. Every record since this album is packaged in recycled materials, and usually available on recycled vinyl as well.

*   [If you want another easy-going album that gets weird](../sketches-of-brunswick-east)
*   [If you want another album that sounds last a past era](../float-along-fill-your-lungs)
*   [If you want another environmentalism themed album but more apocalyptic](../flying-microtonal-banana)
*   [If you didn’t like this and want to get into what the band is better known for](../nonagon-infinity)
