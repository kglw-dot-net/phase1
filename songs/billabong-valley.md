# Lyrics

> Outlaws on the run  
> Faster than a stolen gun  
> Tied naked to the trees  
> Killed so gruesomely  
> Burning tents to the ground  
> Cops won't wave them down  
> The most wanted men  
> Bushrangers reigning in  
>  
> Blood thirsty tendencies  
> Antiauthority  
>  
> Mad dog Morgan  
> He never gave a warning  
> Mad dog Morgan  
> Shot in the back by morning  
>  
> Outlaws on the run  
> Faster than a stolen gun  
> Tied naked to the trees  
> Killed so gruesomely  
> Burning tents to the ground  
> Cops won't wave them down  
> The most wanted men  
> Bushrangers reigning in  
>  
> Blood thirsty tendencies  
> Antiauthority  
>  
> Mad dog Morgan  
> He never gave a warning  
> Mad dog Morgan  
> Shot in the back by morning
