# Lyrics

> The spawn of Satan's back  
> It's made of steel and black  
> It comes to bring you pain  
> It comes again and again  
>  
> Road train  
>  
> The spawn of Satan's here  
> It's come to bring you fear  
> It sets the road aflame  
> It comes to kill and maim  
>  
> Road train  
>  
> Lights that shine like bulging eyes  
> Keep on trucking through the night  
> The vortex opens through  
> Drive right in and straight through you  
>  
> The spawn of Satan comes  
> It's carting oil and drums  
> It's racing down the lane  
> With oily fiery rain  
>  
> Road train  
> 
> 26 gears of petrol power  
> Keep on trucking hour by hour  
> One man is at the wheel  
> He's the dog at Satan's heel  
>  
> Across the desert to the trees  
> Obliteration of the place  
> From the fire into the sea  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Is coming!  
>  
> The spawn of Satan speeds  
> The road beneath it bleeds  
> It comes to bring you shame  
> It comes again and again  
>  
> Road train  
>  
> Burning wheels of fiery red  
> Keep on trucking till we're dead  
> The beast is angry too  
> Drive real fast and eat up you  
>  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Nonagon infinity  
> Is coming!
