# Lyrics

> Look past the dying trees, beyond waterless seas,  
> Atop the horizon, adjacent to the sun.  
> Give my word that it's there - magenta mountain.  
>  
> What do you mean, you can't see it?  
> My life must be a dream - a living fantasy.  
> Disappeared in hot air - magenta mountain.  
>  
> I don't believe you  
> Your eyes deceive you.  
> Better check yourself in.  
> The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream.  
> Can't you see you've gone insane?  
>  
> I packed my bags and my swag for the road.  
> Followed the bows of the ancient railroads.  
> Need to rendezvous where clouds can't misconstrue.  
> I'm certain it is real - magenta mountain.  
>  
> You will say I'm crazy.  
> I will go on my way 'cos it's what I need.  
> I'd cross a thousand seas just to prove I'm not mad.  
> Magenta mountain.  
>  
> Magenta mountain.  
> 
> It's you again.  
> Yeah.  
> I thought I saw a statue blink and a bird with no head.  
> Land on a golden thread.  
> I rub my eyes.  
> What am I saying?  
> There's nothing there.  
>  
> Magenta mountain.  
> Magenta mountain.  
> It's my sanctuary, that I wanna be chasing every chance I get.  
> Don't wanna be left.  
> Never not making it there.  
>  
> What was confusing is now seducing.  
> Imagination is a powerful thing.  
> I see a flash of purple stone closing in.  
>  
> Magenta mountain.  
> Magenta mountain.  
> It's my sanctuary that I wanna be chasing every chance I get.  
> Don't wanna be left.  
> Never not making it there.  
>  
> I am tectonic.  
> I am megalithic.  
> My spirit runs mauve.  
> I am the mountain of which you dream.  
> I see you now behind the lens looking back at me.  
>  
> Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo...  
> We fell through a dream across clouds of glue.  
> Anamnesis crashing through.  
>  
> Magenta mountain.  
> Magenta mountain.  
> Magenta mountain.  
> Magenta mountain.
