# Lyrics

> Dreaming takes  
> My mind away  
> It suffocates  
> My brain airwaves  
>  
> Optical illusion  
> A sheet of water  
> Heat profusion  
> Search the corners  
>  
> Last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis  
> Alone in this weather that covers our world  
> Last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut - adagio  
> We have nowhere to go  
>  
> Dreaming takes  
> My mind away  
> It suffocates  
> My brain airwaves  
>  
> Optical illusion  
> A sheet of water  
> Heat profusion  
> Search the corners  
>  
> The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known  
> Rara avis shedding her feathers one at a time  
> The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands  
> Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home  
>  
> Dreaming takes  
> My mind away  
> It suffocates  
> My brain airwaves  
>  
> Optical illusion  
> A sheet of water  
> Heat profusion  
> Search the corners  
>  
> Optical illusions  
> Living movements  
> To be proven  
> Says Zurbuchen  
>  
> The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind  
> The world has wasted and the squandered lands are compassionless  
> The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse over  
> Lonely countries of death, like yellow sea
