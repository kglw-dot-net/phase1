# Lyrics

> I have gone insane-o. I lust for volcano. Be with molten lava.  
> Give me my nirvana! I have no vertigo. I lust for tornado.  
> Be a leaf upon air. Venusian mal-de-mer.  
>  
> Venusian: sickness dire. I want to be set on fire. Venusian.  
> Gather while I Venusian-ly catch on fire.  
>  
> Auto-Cremate. Self-Immolate.  
>  
> Like a bird in a cage; airostat-habitat. To motion I am slave.  
> Give me hell; I want that! Venusian sickness. Venusian bilious.  
> Venusian nausea. Venusian mal-de-mer.  
>  
> Venusian: sickness dire. I want to be set on fire. Venusian.  
> Gather while I Venusian-ly catch on fire.  
>  
> Auto-Cremate. Self-Immolate.
