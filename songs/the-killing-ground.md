# Lyrics

> Chapter 5:
>  
> For days they traveled, the young man and the Yavapai girl. She told him her name and they spoke in the language.  
> They rode the horses until they gave out then their throats were slit and meat was taken to eat later.  
> No fires were lit and they ate berries and raw jackrabbit as well to keep going.  
> After a week they relaxed more as they entered Apacheria.  
>  
> They saw dust way off like dust devils but they knew it was horses. They could hear shots and no more.  
> When all was quiet a day later they moved silently towards the killing ground.  
>  
> The buzzards told them the story before they got there.  
> Dead white people, a lot of them, maybe a half dozen and burnt wagons and arrows.  
> But not from one tribe. Some of the arrows were different and shod hoofmarks  
> And moccasin tracks that were shaped like a white man's way of walking.  
> Some white men had done this loosely disguised as Apache.  
>  
> They took what they could use and walked on.  
> The purple mountains and red ochre earth swallowed them up and the young man smelt his own blood as they ran.  
>  And it was a good smell.  
>  
> The smell of being alive.
