# Lyrics

> And now dear listener we cross to the foe  
> The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo  
>  
> I am the sabre! The catapult and bat!  
> The top of the food chain in my habitat!  
>  
> I am the demon bearing misery and fear!  
> And I spy you convulsing from way over here!  
>  
> I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces  
> I could make you bleed crimson tears from the lesions  
>  
> But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get  
> Is to take over your body and to be in your head  
>  
> I see you  
> I want to  
> Break your head  
> Crusty bread  
>  
> I won't quit  
> If you quip  
> See to it  
> That you slip  
>  
> I see you  
> I want to  
> Seize your brain  
> I'd like to put it in my head!  
>  
> To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat  
> Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat  
>  
> Tell me would you honestly  
> Dare to face up next to me  
> Sugar coated pills won't keep  
> You from feeling so woozy  
>  
> I am an altered beast!  
>  
> What harm could a mere mortal like you do?  
> I am the golden wolf and you are caribou  
>  
> My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork  
> I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork  
>  
> I see you  
> I want to  
> Make a waste  
> Of your home  
>  
> I won't leave  
> I might tease  
> I'll be here  
> Await your death  
>  
> I see you  
> I want to  
> Seize your brain  
> I'd like to put it in my head!  
>  
> I see you are nervous, I see you are fumbling  
> Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling!  
>  
> Tell me would you honestly  
> Dare to face up next to me  
> Sugar coated pills won't keep  
> You from feeling so woozy  
>  
> Tell me would you honestly  
> Dare to face up next to me  
> Sugar coated pills won't keep  
> You from feeling so woozy  
>  
> I am an altered beast!
