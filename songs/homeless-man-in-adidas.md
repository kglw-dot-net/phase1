# Lyrics

> I'm not lonely  
> The city keeps me company  
> Sit on the roof  
> Watch the cars travel past  
> Ain't no way of getting lonely  
> I'll sit real still and watch everyone go fast  
> With only me  
> Lay on the bay  
> Watch it all float away  
> Ain't no way of getting lonely  
> Watch all the people and the bikes come my way  
> With only me
