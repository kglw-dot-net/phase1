# Lyrics

> Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth  
> Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth  
> Faceless night cowers underneath the ever changing moonlit sky  
> Can you believe the way night falls away?  
> As the sun starts a new day  
>  
> Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye  
> Dusk greets the horizon as day fades  
> Black lines bend round a cityscape while trailing off in the sunset's wake  
> I can foresee that dawn will bring the light  
> As the sun gives way to night
