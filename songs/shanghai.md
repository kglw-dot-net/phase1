# Lyrics

> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> Bye bye my life.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bright lights up high.  
> Dark thoughts in my mind.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bright lights up high.  
> Grey smog all the time.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight.  
>  
> Ok, let me my trace my steps.  
> Pour a drink let's recap the sequence.  
> One minute, you're swigging on a green tea,  
> next minute, floating on a pillow in a den.  
> From there it gets a little hazy, like a camera out of focus shaking.  
> Slow motion in the club free-falling through my seat, hit the floor transforming.  
> Undergoing complete metamorphous from a moth caterpillar to chrysalis.  
> Spinning in a silken house like a spider spins a web.  
> I'm a well known insect.  
>  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> Bye bye my life.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bright lights up high.  
> Dark thoughts in my mind.  
> Born-again overnight.  
>  
> Bright lights up high.  
> Grey smog all the time.  
> Born-again overnight.  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight.  
>  
> Flying through the Yu garden to the People's Square.  
> That's where you find your happiness.  
> With a little too much Szechuan in the pot sending sensational content.  
> Neck stuck from looking up at the high rise buildings trying to caress.  
> Enlightenment through an out of body experience.  
> You're thriving in this environment.  
> Come find me on almost every continent.  
> Coldblooded but I can't stand the antarctic.  
> Guess I've been born again overnight.  
>  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight...  
> Bye bye Shanghai.  
> I've become a butterfly.  
> Born-again overnight...
