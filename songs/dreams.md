# Lyrics

> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel awake in the night.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel tired in the day.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna run away.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna run and hide.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only like it when I can't see.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only need the castle in the air.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna keep my eyes glazed.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel alive in a daze.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
>  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel awake in the night.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel tired in the day.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna run away.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna run and hide.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only like it when I can't see.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only need the castle in the air.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna keep my eyes glazed.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only feel alive in a daze.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.  
> I only wanna wake up in my dream.
