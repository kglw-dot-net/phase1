# Lyrics

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium...

I ain't a bald primate
That tongue does not relate
Man is done
The ape is dead
Lungs of the planet on a golden thread
I ain't debating
I'm a mushroom, ok
I spread like lava
Rise like bread
Currency of decay
Amongst my kin, I extend acidic salutations
Exhale the dust of seasons
Inhale the breath of civilisations
I grip with devils fingers and stroke the green curtain
We, the thoughtful element
Dumb rock
Unthinking ocеan
Network of the wood
Tannin of the еvening
Synapse of the bush
I disappear amongst my kin

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium...

I ain't a bald primate
That tongue does not relate in any way
Man is done
The ape is dead
Lungs of the planet on a golden thread
And I ain't debating now
I'm a mushroom, ok
I spread like lava
Rise like bread
Paralysed agaric fungus

Fed back into the, the bourgeoisie
What the hell is happening to me?

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium...

Paralysed agaric fungus
Toadstool dome grown humongous
Stomach knots and purple skin
Mirrored faces doubling
Bursting beams of hopping rabbits
Organs bleed with sucking maggots
Metallic teeth
Ancient Goblet
Increase the dosage with a droplet
Blackened gold beneath the surface
Dark horse undermining and amorphous
Fed back into the bourgeoisie
What the hell is happening to me?
Spore filled breath
I'll spread myself over the forest floor and infest the elk
Feasting on decay and sprouting anew
I'll make my biome part of mycelium

Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium. Mycelium...
