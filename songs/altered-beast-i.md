# Lyrics

> I think I see  
> An altered beast  
> By the tree  
>  
> Take a peek if you would dare  
> Half made of man, half of bear  
>  
> He came from underneath  
> I met an altered beast!  
>  
> I think I see  
> An altered beast  
> By the creek  
>  
> Altered face and altered skin  
> Altered horde of altered kin  
>  
> He came from underneath  
> I met an altered beast!  
>  
> I think I see  
> An altered beast  
> In my dreams!  
>  
> In a dream you can wake in your bed without pain  
> But know with conviction it's here you'll remain  
>  
> I met an altered beast!  
>  
> With an unsteady gait the critter moves forth  
> You feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth  
>  
> And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread  
> As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head  
>  
> And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain  
> And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain  
>  
> Closer he comes making dust out of stone  
> Forsaken, you are, and what's more, all alone  
>  
> I think I see  
> An altered beast  
> By the tree  
>  
> I met an altered Beast!
