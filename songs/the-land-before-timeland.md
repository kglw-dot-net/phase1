# Lyrics

> It's good to be back  
> Re-railed  
> Back on track  
> Change the clock through sleight of hand  
> The river has been spanned  
> Behold: the land before Timeland  
>  
> Teleportality  
> Teleport you and me from possibility to actuality  
> Denim laminated  
> Past illuminated  
> Evil stimulated  
> Future pixelated  
>  
> Laminated denim  
>  
> Laminated denim  
> Rattlesnake venom  
> Serpent-man demon  
> Laminated denim  
> Hide-out in the plenum where they can't get us  
> Warmer air can benumb  
> Laminated denim  
>  
> Laminated denim  
> The forces came to hem in  
> They'll get in if we let them  
> Laminated denim  
> Sunrise gameplan  
> Sky like a lemon  
> In death I'll be a free man or woman  
> Laminated denim  
>  
> It's good to be back  
> Re-railed  
> Back on track  
> Change the clock through sleight of hand  
> The river has been spanned  
> Behold: the land before Timeland  
>  
> Teleportality  
> Teleport you and me from possibility to actuality  
> Denim laminated  
> Past illuminated  
> Evil stimulated  
> Future pixelated  
>  
> Laminated denim  
>  
> Laminated denim  
> Satanic journeyman  
> Seven metre wingspan  
> Laminated denim  
> Fire-winds are blowing  
> Hourglass is going  
> Long nights are impending  
> Laminated denim  
>  
> It's good to be back  
> Re-railed  
> Back on track  
> Change the clock through sleight of hand  
> Ooh, the river has been spanned  
> Behold: the land before Timeland
