# Lyrics

> Once you're in the zone  
> The river flows down like a full stone  
> Water is your bed  
> The ripples cushion your head  
>  
> I can't believe it  
> It is frozen  
> It's not the first time  
> I had noticed  
> She will deliver  
> I am floating  
> Trust in the river  
> I had floated down  
>  
> Floated down...  
>  
> Down  down  down...  
>  
> Once you're where I led  
> It will be clear what I have said  
> Float without a home  
> The river flows like another long road  
>  
> Frozen over home  
> The fading light shines on the white stone  
> Melt your little zone  
> And sink into the waterfall flow
