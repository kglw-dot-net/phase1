# Lyrics

> Everything's dead here  
> Covered with plastic  
> Everything's fluro  
> Evergreen matter  
> Gotta stop grass growin'  
> Cover that wormhole  
> Gotta stop birds from shitting on my lawn  
> When it don't matter everything's better  
> Throwaway plates are better for business  
> Everything's easy  
> Better for the earth is astroturf  
>  
> Six butterflies fluttered by  
> Looked horrified  
> "I just hatched from chrysalis  
> I've only hours, 36  
> I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die  
> Heartbreaking way to end  
> I will cry on astroturf"  
>  
> Suitable texture  
> Suitable color  
> Miniature forest  
> Better than nature  
> Make me feel better knowing I won't go out  
> On my lawn and see an animal  
> Everything's sterile  
> Even infertile  
> Proud of my monster  
> It's never been straighter  
> Dog shit heaven  
> Better than the earth  
> It's astroturf  
>  
> Six butterflies fluttered by  
> Looked horrified  
> "I just hatched from chrysalis  
> I've only hours, 36  
> I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die  
> Heartbreaking way to end  
> I will cry on astroturf"  
>  
> Astroturfing  
> Astroturfing  
> Astroturfing...  
> Better than the earth is astroturf  
>  
> Six butterflies fluttered by  
> Looked horrified  
> "I just hatched from chrysalis  
> I've only hours, 36  
> I need a mate to do my biz and this is where I will die  
> Heartbreaking way to end  
> I will cry on astroturf"
