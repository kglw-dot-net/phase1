# Lyrics

> To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant.  
> To a tree, what's a house? Is that even relevant?  
>  
> Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane?  
>  
> To a cow, what is a car? It's a deadly predator.  
> To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant.  
> To a tree, what's a house? Can it think at all?  
>  
> Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane?  
>  
> To a cloud, what is a breeze? It's a predetermined sneeze.  
> To a seal, what is real? Surely more than it can feel.  
> To a bird, what's a plane? A shiny flying elephant.  
> To a tree, what's a house? Is that even relevant?  
>  
> Does a bird know its name? To a bird, what's a plane?  
>  
> To a bird, what's a plane?
