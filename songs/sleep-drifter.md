# Lyrics

> Drifting in and out of sleep  
> Is my favourite state to be  
> I can see you next to me  
> And it is lovely  
>  
> Sleep drifter, sleep drifter  
>  
> I can feel you touch me  
> And I can hear you breathing  
> Please no one wake me  
> When I'm sleep drifting  
>  
> Drifting in and out of sleep  
> Reality begins to fray  
> You become so close to me  
> In a hotel far away  
>  
> Sleep drifter, sleep drifter  
>  
> I can know you're right here  
> And I can catch your crying tear  
> We can be so close dear  
> When I'm sleep drifting  
>  
> Drifting in and out of sleep  
> Is my favourite state to be  
> I can see you next to me  
> And it is lovely  
>  
> Sleep drifter, sleep drifter  
>  
> I can feel you touch me  
> And I can hear you breathing  
> Please no one wake me  
> When I'm sleep drifting  
>  
> I can know you're right here  
> And I can catch your crying tear  
> We can be so close dear  
> When I'm sleep drifting  
>  
> I can feel you touch me  
> And I can hear you breathing  
> Please no one wake me  
> When I'm sleep drifting  
>  
> Sleep drifter, sleep drifter  
>  
> Sleep drifter, sleep drifter  
>  
> I can feel you touch me  
>  
> And I can hear you breathing  
>  
> Please no one wake me  
>  
> When I'm sleep drifting
