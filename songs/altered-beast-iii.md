# Lyrics

> I know I see  
> An altered beast  
> By the tree  
>  
> Find a place to hide  
> Where I could steal a peep  
> Look to the sky  
> And I see angels weep  
>  
> And he said:  
> "I see you  
> And I can see right through  
> I see you  
> And I will take you to my altered world"  
>  
> Nine white teeth  
> My gums bequeathed  
>  
> Hair on my skin  
> And I'm feeling beastly  
> Feel it trickle in  
> A new life with me  
>  
> And he said:  
> "I see you  
> And I can see right through  
> I see you  
> And I will take you to my altered world"  
> 
> Nine white teeth  
> My gums bequeathed  
>  
> Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed  
> Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn  
>  
> I see you  
> I can see right through  
> I see you  
> I can see right through  
> I see you  
> I can see right through  
> I see you  
> And I'll take you to my altered world  
>  
> I am an altered beast!
