# Lyrics

> It's coming up beach boys.  
> It's gonna be a lot of fun.  
> The water's getting deeper.  
> It's gonna drown everyone.  
> It's coming up beach boys.  
> The weathers getting messed about.  
> You better bring boards down.  
> The waves are bigger than a house.  
>  
> 2.02 killer year.  
> No fear.  
> Proceed without blame.  
> No shame.  
> Playing games with lives unborn.  
> No scorn.  
> Not torn between just and fucked up.  
> We've stuffed up.  
> Time to pick up.  
>  
> It's coming up beach boys.  
> It's gonna be a lot of fun.  
> The water's getting deeper.  
> It's gonna drown everyone.  
> It's coming up beach boys.  
> The weathers getting messed about.  
> You better bring boards down.  
> The waves are bigger than a house.  
>  
> 2.02 killer year.  
> The year that broke our broken wheel.  
> Is it enough that we're a speck of dust, speeding though a void of stuff?  
> We teeter on an axe edge.  
>  
> Water signage; never read it.  
> How pathetic.  
> Coinciding.  
> Mystifying.  
> Sleep declining.  
> Too little, too late to contemplate.  
> Gotta make moves: cannot wait.  
> Need to recreate a clean slate.  
> Plan B, C and D.  
> However many needs it needs to be to keep us free in ecstasy.  
> It's easier to swallow hiding in your burrow.  
> No need to wallow in your sorrows.  
>  
> It's coming up beach boys.  
> It's gonna be a lot of fun.  
> The water's getting deeper.  
> It's gonna drown everyone.
