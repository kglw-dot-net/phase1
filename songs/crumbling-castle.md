# Lyrics

> Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine  
> Holding down the fort on the coastline  
> The castle is a pimple  
> On the face of our orb  
> A humble spot for clues to drop  
> If you eavesdrop  
>  
> I see through the bricks to the sea  
> Crumbling castle  
> Water's rising up, thick and green  
> Crumbling castle  
> Inching closer each century  
> Crumbling castle  
> Are we safe in our citadel?  
> Look upon our condition  
> Crumbling castle  
> You would not believe where I'm from  
> Crumbling castle  
>  
> We wait for the death  
> That does not come  
> Crumbling castle  
> Dug all the holes in God's Acre  
> Crumbling castle  
> We have even said our last rites  
> Crumbling castle  
> Are we safe in our holding cell?  
> Look upon our condition  
> Crumbling castle  
> We head to our extinction  
> Crumbling castle  
>  
> The sounds of the constant lightning  
> Would be enough to block out the  
> Thought of the end of the world  
> If it weren't for our tinnitus  
> From the bomb  
>  
> In the wind I sway back and forth  
> I'm brittle as an aged human being  
> There my walls are safe   
> From wild weather  
> The filth forms into great nastiness  
> Polygondwanaland  
>  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
>  
> I don't want to fall into dust  
> I don't want nothing but to live on  
> The ache inside my keep spurs me on  
> I don't want to be invisible  
> Polygondwanaland  
>  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
>  
> On this very day in one thousand  
> Years the earth will be relative  
> To the sun and the moon  
> And a new world will be created  
> I know because it is written here  
>  
> I see through the bricks to the sea  
> Crumbling castle  
> Inching closer each century  
> Crumbling castle  
> Water's rising up, thick and green  
> Crumbling castle  
> Are we safe in our citadel?  
>  
> Look upon our condition  
> Crumbling castle  
> You would not believe where I'm from  
> Crumbling castle  
>  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle  
> I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
