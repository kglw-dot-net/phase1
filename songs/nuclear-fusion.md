# Lyrics

> Look into the sky and see the pattern  
> Reflecting in your eye from a distance  
> Mirroring the stars are the atoms  
> Mixing up like a cocktail  
>  
> The devil's inside all the detail  
> The tittle runs wild under veil  
> Coming together in the pattern  
> Fit tightly like a dovetail  
>  
> Nuclear fusion  
>  
> All the bonds that be  
> Couldn't break us  
> Exponentially  
> In fine feather  
> We're essentially  
> One being  
> 
> All the bonds that be  
> Couldn't tear us  
> From eventually  
> Fusing tightly  
> We're essentially  
> One being  
> Nuclear Fusion  
> 
> Ocean like a moat fortification  
> Separating me from restoration  
> My spirit leaves my body in frustration  
> Flying through the world in radiation  
>  
> The devil's inside all the detail  
> The tittle runs wild under veil  
> Coming together in the pattern  
> Fit tightly like a dovetail  
>  
> Nuclear fusion  
>  
> All the bonds that be  
> Couldn't break us  
> Exponentially  
> In fine feather  
> We're essentially  
> One being  
>  
> All the bonds that be  
> Couldn't tear us  
> From eventually  
> Fusing tightly  
> We're essentially  
> One being  
> Nuclear Fusion  
>  
> All that I ever see is nuclear fusion  
> All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion
