# Lyrics

> Meet me at the house on the top of the hill  
> I've got two important people that I'm ready to kill  
> I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do  
>  
> Santa's on the roof with his presents and sack  
> He's got one hand with a blade and the other's an axe  
> I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do  
>  
> Then I hear God call  
> And all my hate is gone  
> I hear him calling me back home  
>  
> Oh I heard God call  
> And now my hate is gone  
> I heard Him calling me back home  
>  
> God is calling me back home...
