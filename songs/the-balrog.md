# Lyrics

> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog, yep!  
>  
> You made the atom split  
> It caused a massive rift  
> And he came screaming through  
> Here to bite the head from you  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, yep!  
>  
> Balrog fears not the lightning lord  
> He's fixed on us, has Him ignored  
>  
> Feel a tingle  
> Crawling up your left arm when you  
> Think of evil  
> Lurking in the darkness where you  
> Shine your eyesight  
> Something tells you this is not right  
> Take some advice  
> Have you heard the murmurings of...  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, yep!  
>  
> You caused a massive rift  
> You made the atom split  
> And it came screaming through  
> Here to bite the head off you  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, Balrog  
>  
> I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at its expression  
> And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression  
>  
> I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot  
> He is here, fully formed and glowing red and lapis hot  
>  
> Heated menace  
> Comes to gouge the heart out from us  
> Blazing zealot  
> Preaching on the apocalypse  
> I don't want to  
> Submit to his awful torture  
> Save me from him  
> Have you heard the murmurings of...  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog, Balrog  
>  
> Skin begins to burn  
> There's nowhere we can turn  
> There's no way we can win  
> The devil puppets him  
>  
> His pyre muscles flex  
> We are his next subjects  
> His power has us floored  
> Kneel before the overlord  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog, Balrog,  
> Balrog, Balrog, Balrog,  
>  
> Balrog, Balrog, Balrog,  
> Balrog, Balrog, Balrog  
> Balrog, yes, oh!  
>  
> For them the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe  
> And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemathe  
>  
> And as they prepared for afterlife, there appeared the endemic monstrosity  
> The lighting lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity  
>  
> Furious he pummeled his breast and a blaze alit the heavens  
> The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog the lord's finger beckoned
