# Lyrics

> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Meet your maker - the gladiator.  
> Predator X.  
> An undertaker.  
> Annihilator.  
>  
> Your death comes so slow.  
> Attack from below.  
>  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> The terminator.  
> Turns to vapour.  
> Predator X.  
> Sleep forever one fathom under.  
>  
> See to the beyond.  
> Draw the curtains closed.  
>  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Leviathan without a fin.  
> Predator X.  
> Beast from below.  
> Water hero.  
>  
> Forever alone.  
> Make you a new home.  
>  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> Predator X.  
> The looming raptor  
> Smiling gator  
> Predator X.  
> Freak of the deep.  
> Scare company.  
>  
> Your death comes so slow.  
> Attack from below.
