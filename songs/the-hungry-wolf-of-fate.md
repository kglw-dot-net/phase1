# Lyrics

> Would you throw our construction to the hungry wolf of fate?  
>  
> Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants.  
> Do it again cos we haven't learned sense.  
> Do it again so we auto-cremate.  
> Don't do it again because it isn't safe.  
>  
> Death looms like a leering figure.  
> Bring our species into sight.  
>  
> Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants.  
> Do it again cos we haven't learned sense.  
> Do it again so we auto-cremate.  
> Don't do it again because it isn't safe.  
>  
> Would you throw your deduction to the hungry wolf of fate?  
> Fill his plate with your namesake.  
> Fatten him with your ego.  
>  
> Do it again cos we're mindless piss-ants.  
> Do it again cos we haven't learned sense.  
> Do it again so we auto-cremate.  
> Don't do it again because it isn't safe.
