# Lyrics

> Open your eyes and light the fluid; get into it; petrol syphon.  
> Low on meals; browning fields; bury children.  
> Urbanisation, scarification, population exodus.  
> There is no planet B. Open your eyes and see.  
>  
> Open your eyes and shoot the dingo while this shit goes out the window.  
> Multi factions, rusting tractors, dying heroes.  
>  
> Only way through is colonisation, acclimatisation, population exodus.  
> Monetisation, civilisation, the operation has begun.  
> There is no planet B.  
>  
> Patient seasons blacked out for ages. Dreaming of cake. Snowflakes blanket old deserts.  
> Outskirts disperse. Earth is a blank verse. Last hearse. Dry nurse.  
>  
> Open your eyes and see there is no planet B.  
> There is no  planet B. There is no planet B. There is no planet B.  
> There is no  planet B. There is no planet B. There is no planet B.  
> There is no Planet B. Open your eyes and see.  
>  
> Sinners are grinners. Ear to ear. Baby Jesus sheds a tear.
