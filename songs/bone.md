# Lyrics

> Hands and toes feet and head  
> Carrion to be fed  
> And any dog can chew over my bone  
> All my wine's gonna turn into blood  
> When my name is called  
> I'm just a pile of bone  
>  
> But when I'm gone  
> And I'm dead  
> What will be inside my head?  
>  
> Bone...  
> Bone...  
>  
> Fingernail chest and feet  
> Carrion good to eat  
> And any dog can chew over my bone  
> All my wine's gonna turn into blood  
> When my gun is shot  
> I'm just a pile of bone  
>  
> But when I'm gone  
> And I'm dead  
> What will be inside my head?  
> Will all my stitches be unsewn?  
> If heaven is a place I know  
> I won't be taking my bones  
>  
> Bone...  
> Bone...  
>  
> If heaven is a place I know  
> I won't be taking my bones  
> Will all my stitches be unsewn?  
> And when I'm gone  
> And I'm dead  
> What will be inside my head?  
>  
> Bone...  
> Bone...
