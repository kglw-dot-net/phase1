# Lyrics

> Take no position on good or bad.  
> Much watched is the doing so fuck the tarot's read.  
> The life I lead, it has a taste.  
> Like milk drank from the teat, curdles at a certain age.  
>  
> Get with ataraxia. Force it into being. Suck face. Ataraxia.  
> Lower the ceiling; What if I amount to nothing at all?  
> Inside, it hits me up, I care too much about what I think.  
>  
> Shame the mirrors that stretch my hips.  
> Mute the hypochondria that whispers spoilers in my ears.  
> I'm not a father yet so don't ask again.  
> Salt the snail and teach it to obtain.  
>  
> Lay in; Ataraxia. Set the kindling.  
> Weigh in. Ataraxia. Absolve me of my skin.  
> Shame him, name him, cut me down to size.  
> Inside, it hits me up. I care too much about what I think.  
>  
> Get with ataraxia. Force it into being. Suck face. Ataraxia.  
> Lower the ceiling; What if I amount to nothing at all?  
> Inside, it hits me up, I care too much about what I think.  
>  
> Ataraxia.  
> Ataraxia.
