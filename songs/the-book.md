# Lyrics

> God gave me a sign  
> He put it in my glass of wine  
> A great theophany  
> He told me every sinner had to die  
> So I set up my sign  
> And tell the passers-by  
> We are a sacrifice  
> Like it or not I live by the book  
>  
> These aren't fables  
> Between pages  
> My book's ageless  
> And it's page-less  
> 
> The book  
> The book  
>  
> God gave me a knife  
> And wrote seppuku underlined  
> Godly suicide  
> He told me everyone will die  
> So judge me by the page  
> But not by my cover  
> Youâ€™ll learn more with age  
> Like it or not I live by the book
