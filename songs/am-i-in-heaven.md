# Lyrics

> I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say  
> When all the bricks that built our brains will be turned into sand by the eternal wave  
> If we save her we'll live on a star because mother nature made everybody else so far  
>  
> Am I in heaven?  
>  
> Well everybody that I knew has jumped right in and taken over you  
> And I swear even the ocean's changed its hue  
> The lesson rings again  
> Repeats within my brain  
> Let's all put her to the test  
> C'mon suck our mother's breast  
>  
> And everybody that I knew has taken bits and pieces out of you  
> And I swear even the sky has changed its blue  
> The lesson rings again repeats within my brain  
> Let's all put her to the test  
> C'mon suck our mother's breast
