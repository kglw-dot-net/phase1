# Lyrics

> Eat up  
> Vomit  
> Date line  
> Repay  
> System failure  
> Wish for old way  
> Straighten  
> Bend it  
> Decline  
> Spend it  
> Believe sceptic  
> Everybody's standing in  
>  
> Hot water  
>  
> Sheet of paper  
> Mountain raper  
> Moment silence  
> I am spineless  
> Echoes ending  
> Whispers trending  
> Heat is coming  
> Everybody's stranded in
