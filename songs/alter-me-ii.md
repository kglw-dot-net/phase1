# Lyrics

> Your dumb human head is full of naiveté  
> Your impending fate is to be one with me  
>   
> Altered beast  
> Alter me  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me!  
>  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me!  
>  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me!  
>  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me  
> Altered beast  
> Alter me!  
>  
> Now we cross to our friend on the monster's plate  
> In time he will turn and reincarnate
