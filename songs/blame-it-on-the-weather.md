# Lyrics

> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather...  
>  
> Gloomy days make you see the downside.  
> Like an arrow straight through the bullseye.  
> K-hole, spiral through space and time.  
> Stimuli, numb your mind.  
>  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather...  
>  
> Even if you like pain, life ain't a sadist's game.  
> The devil ain't your friend - he's savage.  
> That man on the corner of the street pulled the rug from under your feet.  
> You're flying now so you'd better stick the landing otherwise you ain't got a leg to stay standing.  
> Standing on.  
>  
> Stay standing.  
> Standing on.  
> Stay standing.  
> Standing on.  
> Stay standing.  
> All alone.  
> Oh no.  
>  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather  
> Go on then, blame it on the weather...
