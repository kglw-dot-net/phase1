# Lyrics

> Candles. Candles. Candles...  
>  
> This little man is too hot to handle.  
> Set the funeral on fire with the candles.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.  
> Praying to the gods at the top of a mountain.  
> You'd be better throwing all your pennies in a fountain.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.  
>  
> Your business is my business.  
> Don't ask for forgiveness.  
> Because time is a vessel and our little boat is leaking.  
>  
> Candles. Candles. Candles...  
>  
> This little man is too hot to handle.  
> Set the funeral on fire with the candles.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.  
> I know your hands are up but I really can't stop.  
> The sword is sharp so I wanna chop, chop, chop, chop.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.  
>  
> Luck here matters when walking under ladders  
> Because time is an arrow and our little bow has no strings  
>  
> This little man is too hot to handle.  
> Set the funeral on fire with the candles.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.  
> My little heart is cold as a morgue.  
> Let the weight of it drop like an iceberg.  
> Candles.  
> Candles.
