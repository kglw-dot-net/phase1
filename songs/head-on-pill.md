# Lyrics

> Just yesterday I sat across from my legs  
> They weren't connected to me  
> I couldn't see cause my eyes were in me  
> Hold me up straight while I screw my head on  
>  
> Head on  
>  
> Just yesterday I held the cup to my lips  
> Pouring it deep in my throat  
> Filling up me like a black enemy  
> Hold me up straight while I screw my head on  
>  
> Head on...  
>  
> I ate the wrong pill...
