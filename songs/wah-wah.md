# Lyrics

> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
>  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah wah  
>  
> I can feel the Earth is moving  
> Underneath my hoofed foots earthing  
> Fire protrudes from whence I'm pointing  
> Fading every jewel  
>  
> Thronged upon the rock and metal  
> There's a horde inside this temple  
> Mass around your favourite devil  
> Learn to make them cry  
>  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
>  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah wah  
>  
> See him hover way up high  
> He is the bat with 16 eyes  
> He has a thirst to satisfy  
> A craving for your blood  
>  
> Now here come the wolves with whips  
> And 40 goats with pitchfork sticks  
> And look there is a lunatic  
> He wants to make you cry  
>  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
>  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah  
> Wah wah wah wah wah  
>  
> I'm the chieftain of your feelings  
> I'm the God of air you're breathing  
> You can not escape my dealing  
> I will make you cry
