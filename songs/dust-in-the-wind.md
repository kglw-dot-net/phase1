# Lyrics

> Suddenly the girl pitched sideways and a split second later the young man heard the distant shot.  
> He dived for some rocks and watched as more bullets hit the girl.  
> The young man looked to her body and as she died he worked out where the shots were coming from.  
>  
> And he knew that death was going to walk among the shooters.  
>  
> Chapter 6:  
>  
> There is one thing a white man should never do and that is move towards an Apache because you will never get there.  
> How do you catch dust in the wind?  
> The young man saw the way they were coming by the movement of insects and birds and he knew where to go.  
> Like the snake he slithered into a dry arroyo and worked behind the shots in an arc.  
>  
> After a while he saw them. Three men, three white men clad in skins and they walked confidently towards the girl.  
> The young man knew somewhere behind them another one held the horses, making four all together.  
>  
> He moved towards that man. The killers could wait. Let them enjoy the hunt before they went under.  
> He found the one by the horses. He was young too and died quietly with a surprised indignant look on his face.  
> The young man tied the horses to a tree. They'd come in handy later. Four horses and equipment.  
>  
> At the girl's body, two men knelt beside her while another stood guard.  
> The guard suddenly cried out as his head exploded in a bubble of pink spray and he fell forward.  
> The other two went to ground and nervously called out to each other.  
>  
> "Do you see the bastard?"    "No, he must be close."  
>  
> But he wasn't. A Sharps sporting rifle will reach a long way in the right hands.  
> The young man took careful aim and the smaller of the two men felt his right leg blasted away.  
> The bigger, heavier man sank as far into the ground as he could make himself go.  
> And still he could not see where the young man was.
