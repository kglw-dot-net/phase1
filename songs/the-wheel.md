# Lyrics

> We only sleep at the wheel that steers us into our future  
> We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future  
> Our minds unpack  
> Muscles relax  
> We are superfluous and in a stupor  
> We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future  
>  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
>  
> There's help in need  
> Seek to retreat  
> Yet we decline  
> Without mercy  
> Destroying all that will keep us  
> Heading for a better thesis  
>  
> We only sleep at the wheel that steers us into our future  
> We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future  
> Our minds unpack  
> Muscles relax  
> We are superfluous and in a stupor  
> We only fall asleep willingly at the wheel that steers us into our future  
>  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
>  
> Shivering pilgrims  
> Climb the steeper  
> Path to the idealistic reaper  
> Destroying all that will keep us  
> Heading for a better thesis  
>  
> The wheel that steers us into our future  
> The wheel that steers us into our future  
>  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
> Into our future  
>  
> With hope to prosper  
> What can we offer?  
> Our allegiance surely suffers  
> Destroying all that will keep us  
> Heading for a better thesis  
>  
> The wheel that steers us into our future  
> The wheel that steers us into our future
