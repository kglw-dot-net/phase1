# Lyrics

> I love, I love my Vegemite  
> It's strong as hell and black as night  
> I keep my love all screwed up tight  
> And spread it thick whenever I like  
> I like  
> Vegemite  
> And when everyone's getting grumpy 'cos it's early  
> I'll have breakfast with my girlfriend  
> And we'll have toast   
> With avocado  
> And tomato  
> And Vegemite
