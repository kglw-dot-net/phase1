# Lyrics

> Underestimated technology. I'm addicted to tablet screens.  
> No escaping battleground PUBG. Computer games ain't for me.  
> Can't relate face to face with modern day youth. Outdated; the post millennial will get you.  
> I was born in the echo boom, yet I rust as the cruel millennial.  
> I was only born in '92, yet I rust as the cruel millennial.  
>  
> The cruel millennial.  
>  
> White dog shit; not on my nature strip. Calcium bone conspiracist.  
> Berenstein Bears read to as kids. It's a glitch in the matrix.  
> Can't relate face to face with modern day youth. Outdated; the post millennial will get you.  
> I was born in the echo boom, yet I rust as the cruel millennial.  
>  
> The cruel millennial. The cruel millennial. The cruel millennial. The cruel millennial.
