# Lyrics

> Space is the place for the human race. Chasing the race for the new place.  
> Days on our old place waste. Starship's team full of everybody keen.  
> Pilot in the twilight is a deep dream. Man and machine convene.  
>  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
>  
> Giver of life and the giver of speed. Ever we take; even her gravity.  
> Her glowing beauty is something to see. Bigger and brighter; she cometh to me.  
>  
> Solar mountain comes on the perihelion. No re-routing only counting 'til we're done.  
> Shouting sins until we're in the sun.  
> Peri-Perihelion.  
> Melting humans and everything they bring. In a blink the sun will drink their things.  
> Grinning sun has sinners for dinner.  
>  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
>  
> Giver of life and the giver of speed. Ever we take; even her gravity.  
> Her glowing beauty is something to see. Bigger and brighter; she cometh to me.  
>  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.  
> Peri-Perihelion. Peri-Perihelion.
