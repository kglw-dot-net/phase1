# Lyrics

> Early that morning, the wagon-master of the train came into the post greatly excited,   
> and reported that the dead body of a man and horse had been found in the road about six miles from the post.   
>    
> A company of infantry was immediately ordered out,   
> and proceeding to the spot found the body of Sam Cherry,   
> pinned fast to the ground by the dead body of his horse.   
> The search was continued, and in the lateral canyon were found the bodies of Sargent Love and the three privates loaded with bullets,    
> mutilated and disfigured, but giving every evidence of having sold their lives as great men should.   
>    
> Trails were examined and the whole story worked out.   
> The party traveled along the road nearly to the entrance of the canyon of the Limpia, known as the "Wild Rose Pass,"   
> when suddenly about thirty mounted Indians dashed from the bushes along the stream,   
> cutting it off from retreat towards the Fort, and driving it up the lateral canyon.   
>    
> Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians,   
> regained the road, and ran for life, away from the Fort, followed by a number of yelling savages.   
> He was evidently doing well, when his horse stumbled and fell, breaking his neck, and pinning Sam's leg to the ground.   
> In an instant he was surrounded by the exultant Indians.   
>    
> Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at his enemies,    
> then turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his "last shot."   
> The baffled and terrified Indians went away as fast as their ponies could carry them, not touching the body, not even taking the arms.   
>    
> Such is the way out in the west.   
> People die by extreme barbaric ways.   
> But we're taking their land, and in return they take our viscera and spread it across the desert plains.
