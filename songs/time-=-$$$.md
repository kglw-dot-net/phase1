# Lyrics

> Well if time is money  
> Then it sounds funny to give me so much time  
> And no money nearby  
>  
> I know when my gums start bleeding  
> And pissing over my teeth  
> That I'm low on my buck  
> Without any luck  
> And all I gotta say  
>  
> Why is time my money?  
> 'Cos it sounds funny to give me so much time  
> And no money nearby  
>  
> I know when my eyes start itching  
> That I'm in need of a fuss  
> And I'm low on my buck  
> Without any luck  
> Head in my hands  
> To see that I am so stuck  
> And all I gotta say  
>  
> Why is time money?  
> 'Cos it sounds funny to give me so much time  
> And no money nearby  
>  
> Time is money
