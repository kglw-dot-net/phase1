# Lyrics

> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
>  
> I don't feel blessed  
> With the vomit  
> In my chest  
> I feel like coughing  
>  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
>  
> Queasy green rotten scoff  
>  
> Vomit cough  
>  
> And when I declared to my design.  
> Like Frankenstein's monster.  
> "I am your father, I am your god.  
> And you the magic that I conjure."  
>  
> The thankless swine.  
> The blasphemous jerk.  
> My creature had no love for me.  
> Which made me berserk.  
>  
> "I am covered in vomit.  
> I am coated in sick.  
> I have no name and no place.  
> This is no way to live."  
>  
> So I took over my creation.  
> The spew coated protein.  
> I plugged myself in  
> And became one with machine  
>  
> I don't feel blessed  
> With the vomit  
> In my neck  
> I feel like death  
>  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
> Vomit coffin  
>  
> Filthy green rotten scoff  
>  
> Vomit, vomit, vomit.... cough
