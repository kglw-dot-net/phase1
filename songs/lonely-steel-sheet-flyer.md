# Lyrics

> Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn  
> Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn  
> Lover conceal me  
> All of my body  
> I won't go  
> Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn  
>  
> Lover it's all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer  
> Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye  
> Caught in a wind beam  
> Out in the sky stream  
> Mornin'  
> Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer  
>  
> My lonely wings are ready for flight  
> The ocean is breathing between you and I  
> My lonely wings don't make it right  
> Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly  
>  
> Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone  
> Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn  
> Lover believe me  
> It's not the TV  
> It's more  
> Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone  
>  
> Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer  
> Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired  
> My head is dusty  
> My nose is crusty  
> This flight  
> Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer
