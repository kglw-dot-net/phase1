# Lyrics

> Superposition  
> Real world wisdom  
> Everything is moving to  
> The beauty of the system  
>  
> Total question  
> Fearless reason  
> We; one. I; many  
> Superposition  
>  
> Think between space's seams  
> So your eyes close  
> With my dreams  
> Where truth exists  
> In thought unbound  
> You must know your  
> Superposition  
>  
> Journey towards  
> True destination  
> Be in search of  
> Real direction  
>  
> All of a sudden  
> Heavens unfasten  
> The still will dance to  
> Superposition  
>  
> Exist outside the lace of time  
> And your heart will pump the blood of mine  
> Trace your finger from  
> Birth to hearse  
> And drink the cum of life  
> Visualise your worth and see the place where you'll curl up and die  
> Be the squid and be the ink  
> Me the glass and you the drink
