# Lyrics

> Cyboogie, boogie, boogie.  
> Cyboogie.  
> 
> Cyboogie: A hunk of grey matt. Multitude cells in his metallic dome.  
> Brine fluid floating within, flows between nodes in his cognisance home.  
> Cyboogie: Augmented senses. Scholarship vogue called for celebration.  
> But was it a consciousness can? Bouncy ball thoughts in his celebration.  
> 
> Cyboogie. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie...  
> Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie  
> Cyboogie.  

> Cyboogie's heart is a mess. Cables in knots in his cavity chest.  
> Cyboogie's feeling depressed. Need to de-bug and run over the tests.  
> Cyboogie's ticker ain't flesh. Pistons and pumps under graphine lattice.  
> No people to service the mess when he breaks down in spiritual stress.  
> 
> Cyboogie. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie...  
> Cyboogie.  
> Boogie, boogie.  
> Cyboogie  
> 
> Cyboogie. Lump in his throat. Palpitations and nausea ensue.  
> Cyboogie's chorophobia; terminal error vascular tissue.  
> So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies. Red-bellied trout in a binary brook.  
> How is it that he is depressed?  
> The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook.  
> 
> Cyboogie. Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie... Cyboogie.
