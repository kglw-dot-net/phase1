# Lyrics

> Searching for the way  
> Try to brighten up my day  
> Searching for the gold  
> Inside the rainbow  
> Looking through rose-coloured glasses won't work  
> It won't change anything  
>  
> My body's not a temple, it is a vessel  
> And a blank slate  
> An empty hard drive  
> Doctor please, I'll do anything  
> Alter me  
> Let me see  
> Give me more  
> I want to see the world differently  
>  
> Searching...  
> Searching...  
> Searching...  
> Searching...  
>  
> I've been born again  
> I see the light  
> It's in my face  
> I'm analyzing information  
> Now I am a god
