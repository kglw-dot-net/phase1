# Lyrics

> Death  
> Smells like boiled eggs  
> Death  
> A hot stove glowing red  
> Lava  
> Sticky like peanut butter  
> Lava  
> The ultimate stonecutter  
>  
> Anointed in the bubbling lake  
> Charring lungs asphyxiate  
> Unlike quicksand it's instant  
> Devours whole  
> No longer existent  
> Pumice rain engulfs  
> A mushroom cloud brings tumult  
> Remains are shells  
> Rain won't quell  
> Earth is hell  
>  
> Burning flesh and melting skin  
> I submit to the molten king  
> The messiah deep below  
> Give my essence to the afterglow  
> There I'll speak to the magma lord  
> And bathe in the warmth of the red fjord  
> Past this life of green meadows  
> Lava afterlife in charred plateaus  
>  
> The volcano is death  
> The lava is death  
> Death is life  
> The lava is life  
>  
> The serpent is death  
> The serpent is death  
> The serpent is life  
> The serpent is life  
>  
> The head is death  
> The tail is death  
> The head is life  
> The tail is life  
>  
> The volcano is death  
> The lava is death  
> Death is life  
> The lava is life  
>  
> The volcano is death  
> Death  
> Lava  
> Death
