# Lyrics

> You started everything  
> You started killing things  
> You started severing limbs  
>  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
>  
> You float and wait for me  
> Your scales are hard and green  
> Open your jaw for me  
>  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
>  
> The night is young - full of sin  
> Time to slither away again  
> I can see our history hanging on a knife  
>  
> So let's start dueling here  
> I have nothing to hear  
> Well I'm grinning ear to ear  
>  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
>  
> The night is young - full of sin  
> Time to slither away again  
> I can see our history hanging on a knife  
>  
> So let's start killing things  
>  
> You distort the notion of the place  
> The universes' other face  
> The speed of light has slowed apace  
> The universes' other face  
>   
> What it is  
> Impossible  
> Gravity  
> The universe  
> Has me  
> Invisible  
> Face  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Wait for the answer to open the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Wait for the answer to open the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
>  
> 1, 2, 3, 4!  
>  
> The night is young - full of sin  
> Time to slither away again  
> I can see our history hanging on a knife  
>  
> So let's start killing things  
> 'Cos you started everything  
> And let's start severing limbs  
>  
> Evil death roll  
> Now  
> Evil death roll
