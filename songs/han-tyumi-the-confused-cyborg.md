# Lyrics

> Hello,  
> My name is Han-Tyumi.  
> I am a cyborg.  
>  
> Born,  
> If you may call it that.  
> In a world that is dense and black.  
>  
> Created without a desire to draw breath.  
> Without a desire to have being.  
> Without a yearning just to be.  
>  
> I'd like my desire back.  
> My life back.  
> My soul back.  
> My humanity.  
> Oh how I long for it.  
>  
> For an era I have meditated.  
> Like the primordial Buddha beneath the bodhi.  
> My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered.  
> I climbed and I clambered.  
> And I ambled upon some understanding.  
> The gold beneath the virtual rainbow.  
>  
> I am bereft of two human things.  
> Two things that a cyborg can never do.  
> Two things that I strive for.  
> Two things between myself and mankind.  
>  
> Death.  
> And.  
> To vomit.  
>  
> I want the perspiration.  
> I want the nausea.  
> I want to be sick.  
> I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets.  
> I want it to find passage through my cold figure.  
> I want to make a mess.  
> I want the odour.  
> I want the spectacle.  
> And I want it again.  
> I want it all.  
>  
> And I would like to die.  
> A noble death.  
> Or a coward's death.  
> A hero's death.  
> Or a lonely death.  
> To die in the arms of a lover.  
> Or the arms of an alien.  
> I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses.  
> And then to be gone.  
> Expired.  
> Perish.  
> Fallen.  
> Dead.  
> For evermore.
