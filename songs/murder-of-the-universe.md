# Lyrics

> The spatter becomes a spray,  
> The spray becomes a stream,  
> And the stream becomes a waterfall.  
> Munt is finally cascading from my input.  
>  
> The creeping sick moves from my breath  
> And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body.  
> I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins  
> And eats through the walls of my zells.  
>  
> It bleeds through the pores of my skin  
> And it smells good.  
> It drops from my crotch on to the floor  
> And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads.  
>  
> Inside my body,  
> The pressure is too great  
> And like some ancient geyser I erupt.  
> My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast.  
>  
> Vomit bomb.  
> Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me.  
> I am vomit vomiting.  
> I grow and disperse.  
>  
> Bleeding through walls,  
> I force myself upon others.  
> I slide up legs and crawl down throats.  
> I integrate.  
> I am double,  
> Triple.  
> I am ten times the size.  
>  
> I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile.  
> I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents.  
> Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble.  
> It tastes good.  
>  
> Ten thousand times bigger.  
> I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires  
> At the speed of light across vast electrical networks.  
> I am electric.  
> I am on fire.  
> This is sex.  
> I am every one and every zero.  
>  
> One million.  
> I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell, molecule and atom I can find.  
> I am cancer.  
> I am flying.  
> I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky.  
> I am floating.  
> I am omni.  
>  
> Five hundred million.  
> The world is my interior.  
> It no longer spins.  
> It is altered.  
> My density forces me outward.  
> I am in orbit.  
>  
> One billion.  
> I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms.  
> I am the weather.  
> I am the sun's heat.  
> I am the night sky.  
>  
> Five hundred billion.  
> The solar system is puke.  
> To the Kuiper belt and beyond.  
> I fill the void.  
> Exploding suns vomit comets.  
> Comets vomit acid rain.  
> Spilt milk over the milky way.  
>  
> One trillion.  
> The stars are my cells.  
> Racing faster outwards,  
> Upwards,  
> Downwards,  
> Inwards.  
> Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse.  
> Every-nowhere.  
>  
> I am heavy.  
> I am gravity.  
> Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst.  
> Expansion.  
> I shoot arrows of time in all directions.  
> I am a blackhole shitting into the void.  
> I tear through the skin of perception and into the next.  
>  
> Nonillion.  
> The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent.  
> Like rising damp,  
> Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos  
> And it topples like soggy bread.  
> I am dark energy accelerating.  
> Multiverse.  
>  
> Entanglement.  
> I am time.  
> Centillion.  
> Time is sick.  
> Critical density.  
> Contraction.  
> Singularity.  
> Everything and nothing.  
> Life and death.  
> Murder of the universe.
