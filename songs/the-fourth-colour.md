# Lyrics

> I believe the hyperbole  
> I see the fourth colour  
>  
> Rising up out of my body  
> I am omnipresent for thee  
> Many fingers, many minds and  
> Many eyeballs puppet my feet  
> I walk the streets holy  
>  
> I've been born again  
> I see the light  
> It's in my face  
> My brain is storing information  
> Now I'm a god in a photon  
> I see through walls  
> I see your heat  
> I can see your terror  
> With sight you can see the future  
>  
> I believe the hyperbole  
> I see the fourth colour  
> I can see tetrachromacy  
> I see the fourth colour  
>  
> Rising up out of my body  
> I am omnipresent for thee  
> Many fingers, many minds and  
> Many eyeballs puppet my feet  
> I walk the streets holy  
> Supreme and see all that has been  
> All that will be  
> Third eye is free  
> I am nobody  
> Tetrachromacy  
>  
> I believe the hyperbole  
> I see the fourth colour  
>  
> I've been born again  
> I see the light  
> It's in my face  
> I'm analyzing information  
> Now I am a god  
>  
> Hello.
