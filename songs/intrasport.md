# Lyrics

> Don't take it personally. This is not about you.  
> I begin to slide inward and throughout to  
> Shatter the static silencing my mind.  
> Find the rhythm and set course to collide.  
>  
> Don't take it personally. My hands are disappearing.  
> Dissolving in a tear. I am not needed here.  
>  
> Starting to feel something. I think I'm taking off.  
> I think I'm feeling something. Will I evaporate?  
> Is this me feeling something? I've got a bird's eye view.  
> I have shed my skin. Look at me now.  
>  
> Intra intrasport. Perish to my thoughts.  
> My hand is on the gun. Intra intrasport.  
> Get to me before my face splashes in the sky.  
>  
> I used to dream about killing certain people.  
> Dreams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle.  
> Those feelings that I had were building up to something.  
> I feel a schism in the rhythm. Now I'm running.  
>  
> My hair is liquifying. My tastebuds are igniting.  
> It's true I am evolving. It's all relative.  
>  
> Starting to feel something. I think I'm taking off. I think I'm feeling something.  
> Will I evaporate? Definitely feeling something. I've got a bird's eye view.  
> I have shed my skin. Look at me now.  
>  
> Intra intrasport. Perish to my thoughts. My hand is on the gun.  
> Intra intrasport. The feeling's on the floor. My face splashes in the sky.  
>  
> Don't do it.
