# Lyrics

> All this rock n roll is bad for my ears.  
> Lemme tell you one thing about my life. It's weird.  
> All this headbanging is bad for my brain.  
> Lemme tell you one thing about my life. It's strange.  
>  
> Sugarplum fairy dances now.  
> Echoed feet on the hallowed ground.  
> Energy peaks on the voyager's crown.  
> Back to the bus for another round.  
> Managing feats by managing feet.  
> Head of the hydra tastes the breeze.  
> Conduit sees from the living room suite.  
> Boredom is what boredom breeds you see.  
>  
> So deranged. Life is strange. It's human odd life.  
>  
> All this indecision in anthropoids.  
> Lemme tell you one thing about our life. It's odd.  
> All this wire walking upon the knife.  
> Lemme tell you one thing about human odd life.  
>  
> Sugarplum fairy dances now.  
> Echoed feet on the hallowed ground.  
> Energy peaks on the voyager's crown.  
> Back to the bus for another round.  
> Managing feats by managing feet.  
> Head of the hydra tastes the breeze.  
> Conduit sees from the living room suite.  
> Boredom is what boredom breeds you see.  
>  
> Bitumen crossroad knife. It's human odd life.  
>  
> No concept of geography.  
> I wake up and I'm still fatigued.  
> I'm drinking 'til I'm dead asleep.  
> Riding high 'til I'm back home in one piece.  
> Another carpark in the middle of nowhere.  
> Another promoter hanging in your hair.  
> Another backstage green room to prepare.  
> It's an odd life gotta be aware.  
>  
> It's an odd life 'til you get it right.  
> It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride.  
> It's an odd life, 'til you get it right.  
> It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride.  
>  
> Odd life. Odd life. Odd life....
