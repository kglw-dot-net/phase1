# Lyrics

> Goodbye kinsman  
> Polygon  
> I'm goin' abroad  
> Gondwana  
> Drift until I  
> Polygon  
> Get to my stop  
> Gondwanaland  
> Grand and never been  
> Seen by man  
> Veil of a dream  
>  
> We're gonna get there  
> We don't need a whereabouts  
> We're gonna get there  
> Follow where the river runs  
> We're gonna get there  
> Polygondwanaland  
>  
> Exit snow melts  
> Polygon  
> Float on rain drops  
> Gondwanaland  
> It will get hot  
> Polygon  
> Fasten seatbelts  
> Gondwanaland  
> Sand and mountain  
> Unbosom its hidden hand  
>  
> We're gonna get there  
> We don't need no whereabouts  
> We're gonna get there  
> Follow where the river runs  
> We're gonna get there  
> Polygondwanaland  
>  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Can I see the eye that sees me?  
> Please show me these  
>  
> We're gonna get there  
> We don't need a whereabouts  
> We're gonna get there  
> Follow where the river runs  
> We're gonna get there  
> Polygondwanaland
