# Lyrics

> God, it's pretty hot down here undersurface.  
> Anti-Christ has tempted me with a purpose.  
>  
> Remember where to enter. Remember where to enter. The door to hell is amber.  
>  
> Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell.  
>  
> Here I was thinking I'd die.  
> I see a thousand flies and wings and tail and spines.  
> Nausea-less. Resoluteness. Near the entrance. Satan points me to the rat's nest.  
>  
> Remember where to enter. Remember where to enter. The door to hell is amber.  
>  
> Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell.  
>  
> Remember where to enter. The door to hell is amber.  
>  
> Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell, Hell.  
>  
> XV infantry paratroop into the propylene new scene.  
> Hell's where they wanna be. Infest the rats' nest.
