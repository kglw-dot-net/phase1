# Lyrics

> Doo doo doo doom city  
> Doo doo doo doom city  
>  
> I think I'll die  
> When doom city air this way comes  
> He, in empyrean  
> Breathes from his mouth and over tongue  
> Sky will crucify  
> Tear little holes in my lungs  
> I think I'll die  
> When doom city air this way comes  
>  
> Doom City  
> Doom City  
>  
> Doo doo doo doom city  
> Doo doo doo doom city  
>  
> Spark in firmament  
> Doom city sky opens up  
> He disorients  
> Everyone's lives with his breath  
> Charged with particles  
> Doom city air rips me up  
> Unbelievable  
> Doom city sky makes him laugh  
>  
> Doom City  
> Doom City
