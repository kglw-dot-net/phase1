# Lyrics

> Riddle me this. Did you ever grow?  
> Break the spider's legs just to feed the crow.  
> Sympathetic crowds are not well endowed.  
> Dance like flies on shit swarming in the clouds.  
>  
> This is to all the people who had it coming.  
> A few biccys too many? I'm so lonely.  
> It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it.  
> I'll open their eyes to minimum brain size.  
>  
> Re-enter the uterus and refund all your cells.  
> Do it back-to-front like nobody else.  
> Stay there for a while. "When you're back inside,  
> You will not be missed" said the tear to the eye.  
>  
> It's pathetic though, you're weaker than you know.  
> Parasitic mob. Faceless undertow.  
> Himpathetic bro. You're weaker than you know.  
> You don't have a say anymore.  
>  
> This is to all the people who have it coming.  
> A few biccys too many. I'm so lonely.  
> It's to all of the people who said they couldn't hack it.  
> Radicalise to minimum brain size.  
>  
> It's pathetic though. You're weaker than you know.  
> Parasitic mob. No worse off alone.  
> Himpathetic bro. You're weaker than you know.  
> You don't have a say anymore.  
>  
> At the center of it all. You ain't got the gall.  
> Pissing on a flame. Standing on a ball.  
> It's pathetic though. You're weaker than you know.  
> You don't have a say anymore.
