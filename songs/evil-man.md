# Lyrics

> It is 1864 now, and the American's war has not come to the desert lands.  
> They fight among themselves way off to the north.  
> The Yavapai-Apache are still lords of all they survey.  
> Then one morning the Americans did come,  
> Led by a man holding a leather book with a cross stamped in the leather.  
> An evil man who did terrible things to people.  
> In the name of a god that looked upon the man himself with revulsion.  
>  
> Miguel ran from his wickiup, half asleep when they attacked.  
> A rifle butt sent him unconscious.  
> When he came to, he was trussed-up, on his back, on the ground, looking up at the Americans.  
> He had not been killed because they had noticed his blue eyes and knew he was one of them.  
>  
> So at the age of 16, Miguel was back among his father's people.  
> But once more a family he loved had been killed. This time by Americans.
