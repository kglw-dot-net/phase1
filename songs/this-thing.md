# Lyrics

> Well, I fake a lot of symptoms to be a different person.  
> I try to listen, I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep. That's not to say there's no relief.  
> I like it when it happens; you don't. You're happy? When you show it; I won't.  
> The cycle keeps repeating. I can't escape the rip. There's no stopping what this is.  
>  
> Back in the day your style was impressive, infectious, stress-less.  
> Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport. Full of what you're empty of.  
> I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets that reek of suspicious happenings.  
> 'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick. There's no stopping what this is.  
>  
> This thing we left outside is waterlogged. You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard.  
> This thing we left outside is waterlogged and all that I know is one of us has to wring it out.  
> This thing we left outside is waterlogged. I've thought about nothing but this. I won't escape the rip.
