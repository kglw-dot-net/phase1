# Lyrics

> Who's this Sadie Sorceress?  
>  
> Let me tell you bout this '80s lady named Sadie.  
> She's wild like a witch.  
> She's more fly than quidditch.  
> Smoking winnies and drinking tinnies and glenfiddich.  
> She's a roller blader skating.  
> Masquerading.  
> Squabble and gobble.  
> Eats blood and trouble.  
> Meddles in the metal in it.  
> She flies a handbag freak flag.  
> Dragon scale knapsack.  
> Fur a pelt of mastodon.  
> Brings it on as carry on.  
> Sharp like parmesan.  
> Living non-partisan.  
> Leviathan cardigan.  
> Elegant artisan.  
> Concealing her identity as an evil entity.  
> Anti-sanctity in a vastity quantity.  
> Nightshade bringing death commander.  
> Have a gander - oleander.  
> Poisonous like buttercups.  
> She's dressing up to fuck shit up.  
>  
> Hello love.  
> How are ya?  
>  
> Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress.  
> Snapping necks with her broomstick getting tortuous.  
>  
> The pagan shaman sorceress.  
> Cackling.  
> Bat shit.  
> Non-conformist.  
> Moles on her nose so enormous.  
> The public they can't ignore it.  
> Pitchforks banging on her door.  
> They wanna throw her overboard to see if she floats or sinks into the floor.  
> There she goes bobbing on the surface as the peasants and servants start to yell "hooray, sell her to the circus".  
> But she's had enough of playing it down and playing it dumb.  
> She's dropping bombs on this human scum.  
> Ain't no thing as collateral damage in this supernatural planet with a habit of getting savage.  
> Making sacrifices for the paradise of perdition, the trials and tribulations for the forbidden religion.  
>  
> Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress. Sadie Sorceress.  
> Snapping necks with her broomstick getting tortuous.  
>  
> The most dangerous, debaucherous, Sadie sorceress.
