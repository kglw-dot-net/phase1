# Lyrics

> What in the world is going on? That pretty picture's looking wrong.  
> If happy is all you wanna be, then I can see that the painting ain't painted with love.  
> What in the world is going on here? Your past is built upon your fear.  
> And happy is what you'll never be. I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will.  
>  
> Your real's not real.  
> Your real's not real.  
>  
> What in the world is going on? Can't we all just get along? Our candy is melting in the sun.  
> Can anyone be a martyr from hereafter? What in the world is going on now? Your farm is full of sacred cow.  
> And happy is what you'll never be. I'm afraid that you're lacking some free will.  
>  
> Your real's not real.  
> Your real's not real.
