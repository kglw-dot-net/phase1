# Lyrics

> I distort the notion of the place  
> The universes' other face  
> The speed of light has slowed apace  
> The universes' other face  
>  
> What it is  
> Impossible  
> Gravity  
> The universe  
> Has me  
> Invisible face  
>  
> Invisible face  
> Invisible face  
>  
> I climb up the stalk and plant the bean  
> The universe is a machine  
> That has awoken from a dream  
> The universe is a machine  
>  
> What it is  
> Impossible  
> Gravity  
> The universe  
> Has me  
> Invisible face  
>  
> Invisible face  
> Invisible face  
>  
> I climb up the stalk and plant the bean  
> The universe is a machine  
> That has awoken from a dream  
> The universe is a machine  
>  
> What it is  
>  
> Impossible  
>  
> Gravity  
>  
> The universe  
>  
> Has me  
>  
> Invisible face
