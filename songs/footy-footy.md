> Footy footy   
> All I wanna do is   
> Footy footy   
> All I wanna kick is   
> Footy footy   
> Catch the ball, kick play on! /   
> Crumb the ruck, run, handball!   
> Footy footy   
> Footy! Footy! footy!   
>    
> Ang Cristou, Che Cockatoo-Collins,   
> Phillip Matera, Gavin Wanganeen,   
> Gary Moorcroft, Aussie Jones,   
> Bruce Doull The Flying Doormat,   
> Spider Everett, Spider Burton,   
> Craig Bradley,   
> The 1995 Carlton football team   
>    
> Footy footy   
> Footy footy

> I’m gonna go down to Waverley Park   
> I’m gonna sit on the wing   
> I’m gonna eat a pie   
> I’m gonna buy a footy record for a dollar fifty   
> I’m gonna have a full strength beer ya girl   
> I’m gonna take a specky   
> I’m gonna kick a banana   
> I’m gonna eat a banana   
> I am gonna love every second of it   
> I hate what this game has become.
