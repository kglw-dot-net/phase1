# Lyrics

> For one night I'm the hero.  
> Suit up, tie.  
> Open the doors to The Oval Office.  
> In this story I'm president.  
>  
> I've got happiness inside my pocket.  
> It cost me 25 dollars.  
> Maybe we could go halvies?  
> So gimme just a couple hours starting fires with soggy timber.  
> Then, I'll have the magic powers.  
>  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room, standing at the foot of a rainbow.  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Riding on a Yellow-Bellied-Brown-Snake, sipping on hedonism.  
>  
> Give me 5 - it's all I need to inscribe my epitaph while I float O.B.E.  
> Am I dead or just paranoid?  
>  
> I've got happiness inside my pocket.  
> It cost me 25 dollars.  
> Maybe we could go halvies?  
> So gimme just a couple hours starting fires with soggy timber  
> Then, I'll have the magic powers.  
>  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room, standing at the foot of a rainbow.  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Riding on a Yellow-Bellied-Brown-Snake, sipping on hedonism.  
>  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...  
>  
> Hogtied to self-indulgence.  
> Epicureanly living la dolce vita.  
> Just pass the aux. cord.  
>  
> I've got happiness inside my pocket.  
> It cost me 25 dollars.  
> Maybe we could go halvies?  
> So gimme just a couple hours starting fires with soggy timber  
> Then, I'll have the magic powers.  
>  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Swallowing the sun in a moonlit room, standing at the foot of a rainbow.  
> Everybody here is catching smoke, looking for the ephemeral,  
> Riding on a Yellow-Bellied-Brown-Snake, sipping on hedonism.  
>  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...  
>  
> Not enough hours in the night to keep me on this stinking horse.  
> Everyone's rolling up pineapples, writhing in the space between it all.  
> Long-live my decisions.  
>  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...  
> Catching smoke. Catching smoke. Catching smoke...
