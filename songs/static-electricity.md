# Lyrics

> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Static electricity.  
>  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Singularity at the point of contacting.  
> Lightning strikes deep inside digital cells in my mind.  
> Torn apart like a baguette.  
> Rip the husk from the brown rice.  
> Lacerate the pig flesh and shape the machine out of clay.  
> Blow the brain up in your hand and replace the ashes with static.  
>  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Static electricity.  
>  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Strangers divergent.  
> They were once one. Now they're two.  
> Species come late to the fold.  
> Ships in the night sail on home.  
> Cannonball falls from the sky.  
> Sever the deck with a mind made of metal in plain sight.  
> Invisible ball of death run by a rogue mutant brain.  
> In a bubble of golden static.  
>  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
> Split you and me static electricity.  
>  
> Split you and me. Splitting bodies.  
> Static electricity. Split you and me.  
> Splitting bodies. Static electricity.  
> Split you and me. Splitting bodies.  
> Static electricity...
