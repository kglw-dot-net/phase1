# Lyrics

> Set straight  
> Vibrate  
> Need a hug  
> Coffee mug  
> Minor flop  
> Don't stop  
> What's more?  
> What's it for right now?  
>  
> Days drop  
> Hearts stop  
> Days we've traveled  
> And hearts unraveled  
> Heart attack  
> Hit me back  
> Pig sty  
> Don't cry  
>  
> Cat's eyes  
> Capsize  
> Making time  
> Lifeline  
> Limelight  
> No right  
> What's more?  
> What's it for right now?  
>  
> Nice light  
> Sunrise  
> Bound together  
> Like boys in leather  
> Raisin bread  
> Wreck the head  
> Crack pipe  
> Red light  
>  
> Satan  
> Is hatin'  
> Days old  
> Bread mould  
> Jesus  
> Kills us  
> Exalt  
> My fault  
>  
> Daylight  
> Insight  
> Free roam  
> Go home  
> Bell tollin'  
> Hell holin'  
> What's more?  
> What's it for right now?  
>  
> Freestyle  
> Meanwhile  
> White wash  
> Kibosh  
> Stranger  
> Danger  
> Lightning  
> Frightening  
>  
> Sell soul  
> Keep whole  
> Make some money  
> Eat some honey  
> Make friend  
> Keep them  
> What's more?  
> What's it for right now?  
>  
> Loose mind  
> Kook time  
> Getting better  
> Wearing sweater  
> High brow  
> Cash cow  
> Infinite  
> Rise now  
>  
> Fats game  
> Right as rain  
> Tinned spaghetti  
> Is good for brekky  
> Day bed  
> Rest head  
> Brown moth  
> Red sloth  
>  
> Look smart  
> Make art  
> Golden dragon  
> Subway taggin'  
> Go nuts  
> Make fuss  
> What's more?  
> What's it for right now?  
>  
> Car pool  
> People  
> Oars and paddles  
> Horse and saddles  
> You're gone  
> So long  
> Day's great  
> Go play  
>  
> Playwright  
> Blindside  
> Before  
> Bed sore  
> Deep grill  
> Sit still  
> I'll cook  
> A big chook
