# Lyrics

> The garden goblin.  
>  
> Isn't this the place for you  
> Here in the garden we're safe for now.  
> Behind the tree the garden goblin's looking at me.  
> At me.  
> At me.  
>  
> What's that expression upon his face?  
> Doesn't it look like contempt.  
> Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you.  
>  
> Grow.  
>  
> What does he want us to comprehend?  
> This garden was never his place.  
> Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you.  
>  
> Grow.  
>  
> The garden goblin.  
> What doesn't he want the world to know?  
> The garden goblin.  
> Why doesn't he want to let it grow?  
> The garden goblin.  
> What doesn't he want the world to know?  
> The garden goblin.  
> Why doesn't he want to let it grow?  
> The garden goblin.  
> Grow. Grow. Grow.  
> The garden goblin.  
> Grow. Grow. Grow.  
>  
> Couldn't he be friendly like the gnome.  
> Wipe that smirk right off his face.  
> Doesn't he want to let the garden grow like me and you.  
>  
> Isn't this the place for you.  
> Here in the garden we're safe for now.  
> Behind the tree the garden goblin's looking at me.  
> At me.  
> At me.  
> At me.
