# Lyrics

> I'm stressin'  
> About what I've been missin'  
> And I'm feeling stressin' is an instinct  
> Stress colours all of my dreams orange  
> I'm dreamin' stressin' is an instinct  
> Now I'm biting down on my jaw  
> Now it's making all of my teeth sore  
> Seein' trouble  
> One thing to another  
> I'm feelin stressin' is an instinct  
> My partner is a clever lover  
> She told me stressin' is an instinct now
