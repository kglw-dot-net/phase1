# Lyrics

> Hot wax comin' under the door  
> Hot wax comin' under the floor  
> Hot wax creepin' under the hill  
> Hot wax creepin' under the sill  
>  
> Hot wax  
> C'mon get around  
> Everybody's learning how  
> Come on a safari with me  
>  
> Hot wax!  
> Hot wax slippin' under the seat  
> Hot wax drippin' under the feet  
> Hot wax leakin' under the sink  
> Hot wax leakin' under the drink  
>  
> Hot wax comin' under the lord  
> Hot wax comin' under the door  
> Hot wax comin' into the brain  
> Hot wax comin' into the maze  
>  
> Hot wax risin' from beneath  
> Hot wax risin' from the leaves  
> Hot wax runnin' under my bed  
> Hot wax runnin' up my leg
