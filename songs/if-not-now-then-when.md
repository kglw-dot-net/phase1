# Lyrics

> If not now, then when?  
> When the forest's nearly gone.  
> When the hole's in the ozone.  
> When the bees are gone.  
> If not now, then when?  
> When the ocean's coming up.  
> When the rain just won't stop.  
> When the fire's burning.  
> If not now, then when?  
>  
> If not now, then when?  
> When big pharma's rippin' me.  
> When my data's tracking me.  
> When my phone is spying.  
> If not now, then when?  
> When my choice is monitored.  
> When computers are cleverer.  
> When our food is poison.  
> If not now, then...  
>  
> This is an emergency.  
> Need to act more quickly.  
> This is no quandary.  
> This is an emergency.  
>  
> This is an emergency.  
> Need to act more quickly.  
> This is no quandary.  
> This is an emergency.  
>  
> When the oceans turn to black.  
> When the animals are dead.  
> When the birds are gone.  
> If not now, then when?  
> When the blue sky turns into black.  
> When Gaia hangs by a thread.  
> When all the people die.  
> If not now, then when?
