# Lyrics

> I am my mother's son  
> And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done  
> I wouldn't steal for free  
>And I won't see you next to me  
>  
> 'Cos I, oh I  
> I, oh I hope I don't wake up  
>  
> 'Cos I'm a lonely soul  
> And I've got no friends on this road  
> And I'm a mystery Jack  
> The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track to die  
>  
> Oh, die  
> 'Cos I, oh I hope I don't wake up
