# Lyrics

> Seething pot filled with hot liquid up to the top.  
> Spinning ball with molten core of iron ore.  
> What's it for?  
>  
> Staring out in the dissonance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup in the distance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup engulfing me.  
> Black hot soup.  
>  
> Infinity is in a dream inside a dream you can achieve reality.  
> It gets better.  
> It gets better.  
> Gets better.  
> Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating above who you have been.  
> It gets better.  
> Gets better when you're with me hеre in my own reality with ya.  
> Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me.  
>  
> Colossal fireball falling for an endless floor.  
> Warming wall is moving blind to open shores and open minds.  
>  
> Staring out in the dissonance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup in the distance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup engulfing me.  
> Black hot soup.  
>  
> Infinity is in a dream inside a dream you can achieve reality.  
> It gets better.  
> It gets better.  
> Gets better.  
> Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating above who you have been.  
> It gets better.  
> Gets better when you're with me hеre in my own reality with ya.  
> Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me.  
>  
> Staring out in the dissonance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup in the distance.  
> Black hot soup.  
> Black hot soup engulfing me.  
> Black hot soup.  
>  
> Black hot soup.  
>  
> Infinity is in a dream inside a dream you can achieve reality.  
> It gets better.  
> It gets better.  
> Gets better.  
> Gets crazy when you can be literally out of your skin floating above who you have been.  
> It gets better.
> Gets better when you're with me hеre in my own reality with ya.  
> Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me. Better when you're with me.  
>  
> Black hot soup. Black hot soup... Black hot soup. Black hot soup...
