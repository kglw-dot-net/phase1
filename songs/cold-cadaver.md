# Lyrics

> Dark and cold  
> Out my front window  
> I can hear her say  
> From two miles away  
>  
> "This can't be over, can't be over"  
>  
> Heard her before  
> Knocking at my front door  
> I said, "What's the problem?"  
> She said, "It's the cold cadaver"  
>  
> "Cold cadaver!"  
>  
> I was sleeping  
> When I heard her preaching  
> I said, "What's the problem?"  
> She said, "It's the cold cadaver"  
>  
> "Cold cadaver!"  
>  
> My tongue is big  
> But not as big as his  
> Nostrils, mouth and ears  
> Start to disappear  
>  
> "This can't be over, can't be over"  
> Heard me before  
> Banging on her front door  
> She said, "What's the problem?"  
> I said, "It's the cold cadaver"  
>  
> "Cold cadaver!"
