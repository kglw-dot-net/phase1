# Lyrics

> First I got in mind  
> And then I'll read her  
> What I want the most  
> I will meet a ghost  
>
> First I got in mind  
> And then I'll read her  
> What I want the most  
> I will meet a ghost  
>
> Listen wholly, if you care  
> Save a little time for  
> Ghosts  
>
> Listen wholly, if you care  
> I've got no one right to fear  
> Yes, there be no wickedness  
> So save a little time for  
> Ghosts
