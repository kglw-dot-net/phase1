# Lyrics

> Thawing ices  
> Worse than ISIS  
> Worse than the most deadly virus  
> Living harmonious  
> Is desirous  
> How can we with absent-mindedness?  
>  
> The earth is melting down  
> Our home and our playground  
> Won't be fit for children when our world  
> Has melted down  
>  
> Melting  
> Melting, melting, melting  
>  
> Conflagrated  
> And cremated  
> When the world is consummated  
> Devastated  
> Populated  
> World of isolated mortal folk  
>  
> The earth is melting down  
> Our home and our playground  
> Won't be fit for children when our world  
> Has melted down  
>  
> Melting  
> Melting, melting, melting  
>  
> Toxic air is  
> Here to scare us  
> Fatal fumes from melting ferrous  
> All we discuss  
> Is superfluous  
> If we can't keep our hands to ourselves  
>  
> The earth is melting down  
> Our home and our playground  
> Won't be fit for children when our world  
> Has melted down  
>  
> Melting  
> Melting, melting, melting
