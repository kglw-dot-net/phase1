# Lyrics

> I still hate dancing  
> Oh I still hate dancing  
> I still hate dancing  
> Oh I still hate dancing  
>  
> Whatever you say  
> Whatever you don't say  
> Whatever you say to me won't sway me  
>  
> She's coming straight for me  
> The world's frozen  
> I'm sweating  
>  
> I still hate dancing  
> Oh I still hate dancing  
> I still hate dancing  
> Oh I still hate dancing  
>  
> Slow-mo at the disco  
> And she's putting out her hand to tango  
> Oh no!  
> Her hips are too close for comfort  
> Now I'm losing control of myself  
> What the hell is coming over me right now  
> I feel like I'm about to freak out from the waist down  
> No more caring about what other people think  
> Let 'em kick up a stink  
>  
> I might like dancing  
> Oh I might like dancing  
> I might like dancing  
> Oh I might like dancing  
>  
> Whatever you say  
> Whatever you don't say  
> Whatever you say to me is gonna swing me  
>  
> I was just joking  
> I love it  
> I was just kidding  
> I love it  
>  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing  
> I feel like dancing  
> Oh I feel like dancing
