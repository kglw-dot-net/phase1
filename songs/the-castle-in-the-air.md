# Lyrics

> The river opened her mouth  
> And spat into a vast sea  
> Larger and bluer  
> Than a cloudless sky.  
> Muscular, prodigious, immortal.  
> But our vessel was invulnerable.  
> It was well built.  
> The boat rocked me into sleep  
> And I floated  
> Through a deep dream.  
> Smooth sailing  
> Through the castle in the air.  
>  
> One-eyed people living peaceful  
> With monopods and astomi  
> Without malice or guile  
> Without covetousness  
>  
> And there's men  
> Whose heads do grow  
> Beneath their shoulders  
> Maybe we'll find  
> The world's center  
> Where equinox  
> Casts no shadow  
> Spread our teaching  
> Alleviate their damnation  
>  
> Without us they'll go to hell  
> We are casting spells  
>  
> Could it be faithful?  
> Couldn't seem more real  
> As I opened my eyes  
> The dream decolourized  
> 'Till it was obscured  
> And the harsh reality  
> Hit me like salty water
