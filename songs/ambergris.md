# Lyrics

> Breathing heavy candles.  
> Cut a face from a smile.  
> Preserve the torch; it's imperative.  
> So douse some fuel on the fire.  
>  
> Some dogs get whale eye.  
> Got a nose for that sea spice.  
> I wish that I had strength like that.  
> Dominion over my chemistry.  
>  
> Didn't you know?  
> The camel's out of water.  
> The dog sweat on the seat.  
> Had me slippin' like a creep.  
>  
> Haven't you heard?  
> They worked out double standards.  
> Apply only to me.  
> Finally, it's working.  
> Ambergris.  
>  
> Sculpting confidence with chimney smoke.  
> Record my weight in kidney stones.  
> CFCs gnaw at my intellect.  
> Colour coding my lymph nodes.  
>  
> Anthropomorphise everything.  
> Use my blowhole like a microphone.  
> Every night I dream that you will see.  
> The harpoon that I've grown to need.  
>  
> Apropos,  
> The camel's out of water.  
> The dog sweat on the seat.  
> Had me slippin' like a creep.  
>  
> Ergo,  
> I worked out double standards.  
> Apply only to me.  
> Finally, it's working.  
> Ambergris.
