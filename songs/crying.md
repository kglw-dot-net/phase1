# Lyrics

> Came in my window crying  
> Said that she's sick of all his lying about me  
> I said I ain't got time for her  
> I'm gonna close the door when I go walking  
> Out!  
> Came to me Monday Morning  
> Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning  
> He said the same thing that she said  
> Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't  
> Mine!  
> Baby you always acted like baby you never cared  
> With the way you act girl you're bound to make your guy  
> Cry!  
> Well I ain't gonna be the one to watch you fall down the stairs  
> With the way you act girl you're bound to make your guy
