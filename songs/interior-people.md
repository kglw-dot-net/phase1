# Lyrics

> Just on the down low, I'm feeling pretty low.  
> Some days I feel fine.  
> Others... I don't know.  
> I got a sensory road block.  
> I'm in a binary mind lock.  
> So I'm dancing in lockstep to music that I can't hear.  
>  
> Failing farmer; toxic crop.  
> Two white hearts to shake shit up.  
> Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the dry wall inside my skull.  
>  
> Interior people.  
> A lens flare in my subconscious.  
> The gap of death, I no longer fear.  
> The Interior People.  
>  
> I keep thinking someone.  
> Is standing beside me.  
> When I turn to grab 'em.  
> They jump back inside me.  
> They tell me to do things.  
> And so does the radio.  
> And learn from the satellite.  
> That orbits my shadow.  
>  
> Instigate the paradigm.  
> Play the game and drink the wine.  
> Communicate with the afterglow that radiates between the wall.  
>  
> Failing farmer; toxic crop.  
> Two white hearts to shake shit up.  
> Pay someone to taste, to smell and punch through the dry wall inside my skull.  
>  
> Interior people.  
> A lens flare in my subconscious.  
> The gap of death, I no longer fear.  
> The Interior People.
