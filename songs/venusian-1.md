# Lyrics

> Venusian 1. 
>  
> Forest desertify. Ocean wave amplify. Constant tornado sky.  
> Black water; no supply. Otherworld surrogate. Interstellar; our escape.  
> Sulfur star liberates. Gotta beat the outbreak.  
>  
> We're going to the second planet from the sun.  
> Our ship can deliver us from our ruin.  
>  
> Death admirer.  
> Ground of fire.  
> I heard there's a holy yellow sky - just make sure you close your eyes.  
> Venusian 1.  
>  
> Made of junk from the earth. Human waste; how absurd.  
> Journey is childbirth. Plant a flag, start a church.  
> Sharp as ice in the night. Cutting space; satellite.  
> To a sphere set alight we escape parasites.  
>  
> We're going to the second planet from the sun.  
> Our ship can deliver us from our ruin.  
>  
> Floating helium. Blimp of freedom. Outside air will bring you death.  
> Just make sure you hold your breath. Venusian 1.  
>  
> Ve-nu-si-an 1. Ve-nu-si-an 1.  
> Ve-nu-si-an 1. Ve-nu-si-an 1.  
>  
> I heard there's a holy yellow sky - just make sure you close eyes.  
> Outside air will bring your death - just make sure you hold your breath.  
>  
> There is one planet V.
