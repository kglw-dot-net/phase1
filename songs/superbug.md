# Lyrics

> Superbug comin' up. Feels like he'll never stop. Should'a used phages;  
> instead ya took ages. Superbug gave a shrug and ate all your prescription drugs  
> and never ever, ever, stopped. Deadly contagious and intergenerational.  
> Never ever, ever, stops and never ever gives a fuck.  
>  
> Pony up. Join the club. Shake my hand, let's run amok.  
>  
> Superbug in my blood. Superbug; made of the disturbing stuff.  
> Superbug in my blood. Superbug; made of the disturbing stuff.  
>  
> Superbug comin' up. H1N1 was a flop. Antimicrobial resistance is futile.  
> Superbug is like a truck. Penicillin is a duck that's sitting on the road for luck.  
> Faceless and ageless and simply outrageous. Never ever ever stops and never ever gives a fuck.  
>  
> Unnecessary anti-B's likely killed humanity.  
>  
> Superbug in my blood. Superbug; made of the disturbing stuff.  
> Superbug in my blood. Superbug; made of the disturbing stuff.
