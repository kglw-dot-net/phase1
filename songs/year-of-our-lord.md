# Lyrics

> Chapter 1:
>  
> They'd been watching the farmhouse for a while, maybe all day.  
> There were two of them, both young and fit and desert-hardened.  
> They were lords of where they lived and they had no foreign teachings from white men or Mexicans.  
> Except for one thing.  
> They hated the Mexicans more than the white men because of their cruelty.  
> and they'd learned cruelty from the Mexicans very well in return.  
>  
> The smoke from the mud house curled up into the sky like an albino snake.  
> The two young men watched and counted the white men down in the farmyard.  
> A tall man and two shorter ones, maybe his sons.  
> A woman would occasionally come out from the shack.  
> Get water from the well in the front yard and carry it back inside.  
> A small child would be with her.  
> The men watching on the rim had no calendars so they didn't know the date.  
> 12th of June, year of our Lord, 1854.  
>  
> But one thing they did know: about an hour away were the rest of their party.  
> Eight men, all armed, running smoothly and trackless over the rocks.  
> One of the watchers moved away to tell the main party of what they had seen.  
>  
> The raid was about to start.
