# Lyrics

> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> 
> Fuck all of that plastic wrapped up in my dinner. It's not fantastic. It's gonna come and kill us.  
> It's gonna be massive. It's gonna be brutal. Death will come from plastic. Death will come from people.  
>  
> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> 
> Fuck all of those plastic particles in the ocean. It's like a vendetta against our Mother Nature.  
>  
> The way we wrap it. The way we wrap it is wrong. We wrap it. Plastic boogie. We wrap it.  
> The way we wrap it. The way we wrap it.  
> 
> Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie.  
> 
> The way we wrap it. The way we wrap it is wrong. We wrap it. Plastic boogie.  
> We wrap it. The way we wrap it. The way we wrap it.  
> 
> Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie. Plastic boogie.  
> 
> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> Oh the way we wrap it is wrong. Oh the way we wrap it is wrong.  
> 
> Fuck all of that plastic. Fuck all of that plastic. Fuck all of that plastic. Fuck all of that plastic.
