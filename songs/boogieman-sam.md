# Lyrics

> Well up jumped the boogieman. He ate mumma's babies and shot the shot the policeman.  
> Went down to the nightclub, shocked all the patrons.  
> Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman with the room in his hand.  
> Causing mayhem 'cos he's the boogieman. Causing mayhem 'cos he's the Boogieman Sam.  
> Boogieman Sam.  
>  
> Well up jumped the boogieman. He stole from a punter, the exact shoes he wanted,   
> to carve holes in the floorboards and dance like a demon.  
> Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman with the room in his hand.  
> Causing mayhem 'cos he's the boogieman. Arms are flailing 'cos he's Boogieman Sam.  
> Doing damage 'cos he's the boogieman. He's outlandish 'cos he's Boogieman Sam.  
> Boogieman Sam.  
>  
> Yeah, yeah.  
> Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie.
