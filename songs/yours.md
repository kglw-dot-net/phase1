# Lyrics

> Did you know he's yours?  
> He's the wheel you steer.  
> Tomorrow - Still yours.  
> You can lean on him forever.  
>  
> Your man in the sky.  
> Your bird's lullaby.  
> Your dream in a dream.  
> Your blue butterfly.  
> Your winged Frankenstein materialised as a figment of dream personified.  
>  
> Did you know he's yours?  
> Your security.  
> Tomorrow - Still yours.  
> You can count on him forever.  
> He's yours.  
>  
> Did you know he's yours?  
> He's the wheel you steer.  
> Tomorrow - Still yours.  
> You can lean on him forever.  
>  
> Your third sleeping eye.  
> Your friend in your mind.  
> Can make a vision so real and refined.  
> Like lifetime knowledge travelling ether from a godly cloud to the believer.  
>  
> Did you know he's yours?  
> When you fall asleep.  
> Tomorrow - Still yours.  
> He's a gentle breeze.  
> Forever - he's yours.  
>  
> Did you know he's yours?
