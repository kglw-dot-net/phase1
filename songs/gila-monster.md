# Lyrics

> Anon, a giant monster roams  
> Creature of magic  
> Not of home  
>
> Diamondback climbing walls  
> Puncture wounds  
> Torn and mauled  
>
> Turncoat projectile  
> Idiot reptile  
> Born in the whirlwind  
> Feral wonderkind  
>
> My eyes feel like they're made of light  
> [BoÃ¶tes void](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_Void) would be made bright  
> I will blind you in the [hadal zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadal_zone)  
> Emperor of the abyss below  
>
> Oh, regret, what a cloud of dread  
> With the cold hand of death ahead  
> Oh, desperation, what a mind killer  
> All hail, king [Gila](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_monster)
