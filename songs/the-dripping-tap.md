# Lyrics

> The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world  
> and our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand.  
> The dripping tap won't be turned off by the gods up above us.  
> Big sky country.  
> That we never hear from in these time of our dying needs.  
>  
> A familiar sound ignored.  
> The compartmentalised thoughts.  
> In that back corner of the drawer.  
> That drip, drip on the floor.  
>  
> Don't get drowned.  
> Heed that sound.  
>  
> Left the tap on.  
> Swampin' out of the sink.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Agua flowin' in.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Blankets over my skin.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Wish I learned how to swim.  
>  
> Left the tap on.  
> Swampin' out of the sink.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Agua flowin' in.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Blankets over my skin.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Wish I learned how to swim.  
>  
> The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world  
> And our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand.  
>  
> Drip, drip from the tap don't slip.  
> Drip, drip from the tap don't slip on the drip.  
>  
> Everybody's on the same orbit.  
> When they get old and moronic.  
> Get complacent and get bored.  
> That drip, drip on the floor.  
>  
> Don't get drowned.  
> Heed that sound.  
>  
> Left the tap on.  
> Swampin' out of the sink.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Agua flowin' in.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Blankets over my skin.  
> Left the tap on.  
> Wish I learned how to swim.  
>  
> The dripping tap won't be turned off by the suits in charge of the world  
> And our future's hanging on by a thread with our heads in the sand.  
> The dripping tap won't be turned off by the gods up above us.  
> Big sky country.  
> That we never hear from in these time of our dying needs.
