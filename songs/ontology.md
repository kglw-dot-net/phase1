# Lyrics

> Now there is something that's on my mind.  
> Now there is something I cannot hide.  
> Why is there anyone?  
> Why do we think?  
> What is the point of it?  
> Why anything?  
> Why is there anything?  
> What is the link?  
> What is the point of it?  
> Why anything?  
>  
> Don't question.  
> Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing.  
> Be free.  
>  
> What can be said to exist inside a simulation inside my mind?  
> What is the meaning?  
> What is a thing?  
> What is the point of it?  
> Why anything?  
> How many levels of ontology?  
> What is the point of it?  
> Why anything?  
>  
> Don't question.  
> Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing.  
> Be free.
