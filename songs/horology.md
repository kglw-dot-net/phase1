# Lyrics

> Once upon a time  
> There was a great hermit dominion  
> Veiled from inside and out  
> Ruled by a lone eremite  
> Bringer of an inferno  
> Conduit to Satan himself  
> To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set  
> A demented figurehead  
>  
> Heinous looking thing  
> He was cold and terrible  
> A long and aquiline nose  
> Between swollen temples  
> His green eyes a window  
> To the ninth circle of hell  
> A tiny neck supporting a head  
> Filled with an unbending desolation  
>  
> Seditious bands storm the bastion  
> Alive with revenge  
> Grand intentions  
> Unbeknownst protomartyrs  
> Indoctrinated with impalement  
>  
> Just like that, the plot was crushed  
> Brushed away without a thought  
> Some were found alive though  
> Left to run without their skin  
> Cauterized and blistering  
> Forever marked for all to see  
> Reminding those who think dissent  
> Is a bridge across the sea  
>  
> One did make a pilgrimage  
> In search of a family  
> Evaporated in the dark  
> Stolen by the despot  
> A journey made all the worse  
> Having had his eyes gouged  
> Left without the gift of sight  
> To face his true destroyer  
>  
> Across the land he walked with death  
> Parading his ossuary  
> Upon reaching the castle walls  
> A twist of fate  
> His mind baulks  
>  
> "Sit down weary traveler  
> I am that which you seek  
> Join me in a meal  
> To hear of my repentance  
> Lift the veil from your eyes  
> And look beyond the three  
> Now you know the truth behind:  
> It's tetrachromacy"
