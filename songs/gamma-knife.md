# Lyrics

> Milk and honey for my body  
> C'mon through the door see it's your unborn self  
> Seen it before  
> Fake soul-butter made of rubber  
> Stick it in the skin see it's a wealth of life  
>  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
>  
> Gamma knife  
> Nice  
> Knife  
> Gamma knife  
>  
> Crack the whip I'll jump the hoop  
> Gamma  
> Cut the skin and bend the truth  
> Gamma  
> All I wanted was my youth  
> Gamma  
> All in favor of this troop  
> Gamma knife  
>  
> Milk and honey for my body  
> C'mon through the door see it's your unborn self  
> Seen it before  
> Fake soul-butter made of rubber  
> Stick it in the skin see it's a wealth of life  
>  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
> Gamma knife  
>  
> Gamma knife  
> Nice  
> Knife  
> Nice  
> Gamma knife
