# Lyrics

> Tezeta, tezeta, tezeta, tezeta  
> Remember, remember, tezeta, tezeta  
>  
> If I've been insane  
> My whole life well now I've changed  
> Into something that sees  
> I love the feeling  
> Shape shifting ceiling  
> My mental projection is pink  
>  
> "Come here girl"  
> "Who are you?"  
> "I am true perspective"  
>  
> Tezeta, tezeta, tezeta, tezeta  
> Nostalgia, nostalgia, tezeta, tezeta  
>  
> Everything that lives and dies  
> Is a hologram  
> Nothing is as real as that  
> "Come here boy"  
> "Are you god?"  
> "I am that which I am"  
>  
> "Do you remember now?"  
> "..."  
> "This; my altered plan"
