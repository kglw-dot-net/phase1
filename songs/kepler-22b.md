# Lyrics

> Nerdy kid at school with astral thoughts.  
> Wanted to be an astronaut so I could be alone in space.  
>  
> Get away.  
> Dreamt of Kepler-22b.  
> That's the place for me.  
>  
> Didn't get the grades to be a NASA astronaut.  
> Couldn't knuckle down or focus on my schoolwork.  
> I became a ghetto engineer making shit out of glass to refract the light from distant stars.  
> Then I built a telescope.  
> So big.  
> Pointed it at Kepler-22b.  
> That's the place for me.  
>  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.  
>  
> Can you guess the first thing I seen on Kepler-22b?  
> A telescope pointing back at me.  
> On Kepler-22b.  
> A telescope pointing back at me.  
> On Kepler-22b.  
> A telescope pointing back at me.  
>  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.  
> Good for ya.  
> Obsession is good for ya.
