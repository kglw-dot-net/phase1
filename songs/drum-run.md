# Lyrics

> Chapter 2:
>  
> Miguel O'Brien ran with the Apaches.  
> He ran and ran, and as his legs grew he glided over the desert earth.  
> He learned how to hide and to hunt.  
> He learned to leave no tracks and he learned to live on what he could keep down.  
> And his name was now "Eyes Like The Sky".  
>  
> His blue eyes showed his father's race.  
> He never wore the white painted face of the slave.  
> He was valued for his stamina and distant vision.  
> By the time he was 15 he had already killed Mexican troopers and feared no man.
