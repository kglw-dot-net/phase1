# Lyrics

> I'm the grim reaper.  
> Chimney sweeper.  
> Gate keeper.  
> Running faster than a cheetah preying on the weaker.  
> Got you in my point blank range as I take aim.  
> I'm coming at ya like a hurricane.  
> You're a scavenger scratching around for scraps.  
> Sipping on cactus.  
> Lighting matches.  
> Unburied hatchets.  
> Waiting for the ultimatum to be handed down from above.  
> Never moved a muscle.  
> Never gave a fuck.  
>  
> If it's bad for business and the visits from the hellhounds sniffing out stitches for the snitches.  
> Then therе's gotta be more than justice in discussion for thе ones causing the corruption.  
> Are you having an existential crisis.  
> Time is priceless.  
> Can't advise us.  
> Analyse it.  
> Break it down into small increments to repent.  
>  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper cashes the cheque.  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper cashes the cheque.  
>  
> Heaven sent the silhouette of many wicked men.  
> Fearless.  
> Reckoning thinking they're the most powerful they've ever been.  
> I can't begin to comprehend the arrogance dwindling inside the kranium.  
> Grotesquely tortured by the wretchedness.  
> Whiplash in the fortress between ya legs.  
> Body bags hanging on the hills hoist with a peg as the stench orbits the homestead.  
>  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper cashes the cheque.  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper cashes the cheque.  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper cashes the cheque.  
> Rotting flesh odorous.  
> The grim reaper came to collect his debt.
