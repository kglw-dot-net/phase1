# Lyrics

> Evilest man.  
>  
> I had no choice but to ignore the voices in the newspaper.  
> I feel so sad from what I see.  
> Misinformation around me.  
>  
> I have no faith in what I read.  
> The tabloids and the TV screen.  
> I see it just as clear as the high definition images.  
>  
> Don't wanna scare inaction into you, but what you read you will turn into.  
> Pull up your socks or become a fox.  
> Do you wanna be just like the evilest man?  
> Murdochian.  
>   
> How very long must his arms be to span the distance he can reach?  
> To make all our four corners square.  
> We're in his conservative lair.  
> I wonder if he knows this song...  
> Probably read it before it was done.  
> He probably hacked my phone.  
> I'll change the locks when I get home.  
>  
> Don't wanna scare inaction into you, but what you read you will turn into.  
> Pull up your socks or become a fox.  
> Do you wanna be just like the evilest man?  
> Murdochian.  
>  
> I had no choice but to ignore the voices in the newspaper.  
> I feel so sad from what I see.  
> Misinformation around me.  
> I have no faith in what I read.  
> The tabloids and the TV screen.  
> I see it just as clear as the high definition images.  
> How very long must his arms be to span the distance he can reach?  
> To make all our four corners square.

> I wonder if he knows this song...  
> Probably read it before it was done.  
> He probably hacked my phone.  
> I'll change the locks when I get home.  
>  
> Evilest man. Evilest man. Evilest man...
