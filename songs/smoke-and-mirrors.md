# Lyrics

> Smoke and mirrors steering clear of here  
> Watch you tear up interior  
> Inferior actions, mysterious convoluted satisfaction  
> To see the suffering of  
> All those like you're above us and not among us  
> It's not a concern to see you squirm like a worm in the beak of an eagle  
> It's evil  
> Step back, we must progress to our sequel  
>  
> Smoke and mirrors disappearing when you're near us  
> Uncontactable, retractable  
> You must be held accountable for this  
> 
> Timeland  
>  
> Quit the chit-chatter, backstabber  
> Face up to the matter on a silver platter  
> Talking and diving, you've been hiding  
> Undermining our capabilities  
> This operation is breaking, you're flaking, it's all unfolding at the seams  
>  
> Another puppet to your strings  
> Another sucker with a broken wing (Smoke and mirrors)  
> Another puppet to your strings  
> Another sucker with a broken wing (Smoke and mirrors)  
> Another puppet to your strings  
> Another sucker with a broken wing (Smoke and mirrors)  
> Another motherfucker trying to live the dream
