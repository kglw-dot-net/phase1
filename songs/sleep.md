# Lyrics

> 1, 2, 3, 4  
>  
> I got up early  
> And you've got me up too  
> And you pull me under  
> And you say "My leg"  
> But I don't wanna  
> Go back to sleep again  
> But I dont' wanna  
> Stay like this for 5 more minutes  
>  
> And you always sleep  
> Before the day goes  
> It's time to wake up
