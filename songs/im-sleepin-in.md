# Lyrics

> I'm sleepin' in, in  
> I'm sleepin' in  
> I know within my body I need rest from muscle ache  
> I really need a break so I'm sleepin' in, in  
> I'm sleepin' in  
> I know within my body I need to locate the switch  
> Hidden in me which will turn me off  
> Off, off, off  
> I know within my body I need it  
>  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
>  
> I'm sleepin' in, in  
> I'm sleepin' in  
> I'm sleepin' in, in  
> I'm sleepin' in  
> I know within my body I've got sleepy appetite  
> Pray the darkest night  
> I'm sleepin' in, in  
> I'm sleepin' in  
>  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it  
> I need it, need it
