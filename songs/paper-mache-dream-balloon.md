# Lyrics

> Stuck in a daydream  
> Under a moonbeam  
> Head on my pillow at home  
>  
> Drunk are the people  
> Outside my window  
> Full of testosterone  
>  
> When I get troubles my way  
> Like paper mâché  
> They stick to chimera balloon  
> And I kick it out my door  
>  
> Paper mâché dream balloon!  
>  
> Are you eluding  
> That I am brooding  
> Moping around on my own  
>  
> Stuck in a daydream  
> Under a moonbeam  
> Head on my pillow at home  
>  
> When I get troubles my way  
> Like paper mâché  
> They stick to chimera balloon  
> And I hide it in my drawer  
>  
> Paper mâché dream balloon!  
>  
> When I get troubles my way  
> Like paper mâché  
> I stick them to a dream balloon  
> And I kick it out my door  
>  
> And I hide it in my drawer
