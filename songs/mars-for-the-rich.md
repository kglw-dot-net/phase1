# Lyrics

> Red Mars for the rich.  
>  
> I'm just a poor boy living frugally.  
> I see Mars on TV; I see people happy. I work fields with blistered fingers.  
> I look starward; that world has no place for me.  
>  
> Red Mars. The tsars live large. Red Mars for the rich, rich.  
>  
> Mars for the privileged, earth for the poor.  
> Mars terraforming slowly, earth has been deformed.  
> Just forget it ya ain't comin' here; the ticket's too dear.  
> I stare sadly into my beer. That world has no place for me.  
>  
> Red Mars. The tsars live large. Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich.  
> Red Mars. The tsars live large. Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich, rich.
