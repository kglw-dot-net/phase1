# Lyrics

> You taste like honey. All warm and runny.  
> Kinder than a candy. Effervescent shandy.  
> Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya.    
> The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion.  
>  
> Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along.  
> And the germs outside I'll keep you from.  
> Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song  
> While the mead I make can brew for you.  
>  
> You taste like honey.  
> You taste like honey.  
> You taste like honey...  
>  
> Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it.  
> Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it.  
> We're endless motion. Drink to that notion.  
> Buoyant is your spirit. Gotta keep me near it.  
>  
> Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along.  
> And the germs outside I'll keep you from.  
> Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song.  
> While the mead I make can brew for you.  
>  
> You taste like honey.  
> You taste like honey.  
> You taste like honey...  
>  
> Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it.  
> Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it.  
> Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya.  
> The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion.
