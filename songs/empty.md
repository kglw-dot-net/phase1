# Lyrics

> Empty  
> Life is nothing like it used to be  
> People used to be so nice to me  
> Feeling so empty  
> Empty  
> There is nothing deep inside of me  
> Love is nothing like it used to be  
> Feeling so empty  
>  
> Life is death  
> It's because I shot it through its head  
> I'm wandering around so lazily  
> And feeling so empty  
> And now I know  
> It's because I never set it stone  
> And I'm wandering around so lazily  
> Feeling so empty  
>  
> But I don't feel empty when I'm with you  
> I feel like you level me too  
> Who? Empty  
>  
> What I got myself into
