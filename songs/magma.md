# Lyrics

> Magma  
> Fire bagwan  
> The all, the one and the none  
> Lifts rock  
> Makes stuff  
> The sleeping hawk  
> The ticking clock  
> Hair of child  
> Skin of bone  
> Gift of flesh  
> Exchanged for a burn  
> I'm a drill  
> I drown the earth  
> Tectonic romance  
> Infinite rebirth  
> Magma  
> Essence oozing  
> Molten rock  
> Moving fluorescence  
> Melting all within its presence  
> Forever creeping luminescence  
> Destroying to invent  
> Magma god ever present  
> I live in debt  
> I bathe in glow  
> Subtеrranean web  
> Infest the soul  
> Flying arcs come bearing gifts  
> Praise the return of G.I. Joe  
> Brewing beneath  
> The magma shifts  
> Heavenly bird  
> Luscious cargo  
> Digging deep  
> Burying gifts for the molten god that sits beneath our feet  
> Great abyss  
> Offerings burn in the pit  
> We console  
> Reminisce for the molten god that sits  
> He'll accept those that commit if we dance in the shit  
>  
> Magma  
> Subterranean tsar  
> The scimitar and the neutron star  
> Makes from ether  
> Basalt weaver  
> Obsidian cleaver  
> Make believer  
>  
> A rumble  
> A smile  
> A red tongue  
> Oesophagus  
> A greeting  
> A portal  
> Auto-cremate  
> Immortal  
>  
> Magma  
> Fire bagwan  
> The all, the one and the none  
> Lifts rock  
> Makes stuff  
> The sleeping hawk  
> The ticking clock  
> Hair of child  
> Skin of bone  
> Gift of flesh  
> Exchanged for a burn  
> I'm a drill  
> I drown the earth  
> Tectonic romance  
> Infinite rebirth  
> Magma  
> Essence oozing  
> Molten rock  
> Moving fluorescence

> Forever creeping luminescence  
> Destroying to invent  
> Magma god ever present
