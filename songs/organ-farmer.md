# Lyrics

> Make the incision. Careful precision. Blood minestrone.  
> Decomposition. New life christened. Fatty rolls of brie.  
>  
> Organ farmer. Organ farmer.  
>  
> Delicatessen of our profession. Growing muscle meat.  
> Bring in the carcass. Waken departed. Speak our blasphemy.  
>  
> Organ farmer. Organ farmer.  
>  
> Counterfeit hypocrite runs the mall; runs 'em all. Citadel; Guards it well.  
> Counting coins; counting stem cells. Wiretap divinity. Human laboratory.  
> Kill the squid, cut the tree. Arrogant human being. Meadow's vast.  
> Body parts pulled apart. Partly smart, partly art, partly not.  
> Part of me wants to breathe eternally. Part of me wants to cut out my heart.  
>  
> Farm colossal. Wake the fossil in the fields of beef.
