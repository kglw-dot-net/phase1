# Lyrics

> Chapter 4:  
>  
> The God man with the Bible was in the back room of the chapel at Fort Whipple.  
> The God man was deeply engrossed in satisfying his goat-lust with a Yavapai girl.  
> She never said a damn thing but just leaned over an altar while he defiled her.  
> He held a pistol to her head as he grunted away and when it was finished he shoved her towards the outside door.  
> But the God-man never got to fixing his long-johns or his black trousers.  
> The young man named "Blue" strode softly up behind him and drove a long-bladed knife into his neck.  
>  
> Blood spurted into the chalice on the altar but not the blood of the Christ.  
> Just the blood of the God man.  
>  
> With a cough he died. And a bubbled gurgle.  
>  
> The young man named Blue took the Yavapai girl, money, guns and food, and two strong horses  
> And rode into the desert, away from Fort Whipple.  
> The God man's body was found but he was not missed.
