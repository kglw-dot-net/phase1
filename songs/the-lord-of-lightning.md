# Lyrics

> Lord of lightning shifts his gaze  
> Points his strong finger our way  
> Electricity escapes  
> Leaves destruction in his wake  
>  
> Lightning...  
>  
> Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup!  
>  
> Floating fire  
> Golden wire  
> Silver trails  
> Flashing spire  
>  
> Guns are cracking  
> Bombs are smacking  
> Cat o' tails  
> Whips her lashings  
>  
> Lord of lightning moves our way  
> Sends a crooked look at me  
> Electricity escapes  
> Lights the sky in citrine fleece  
>  
> Lightning...  
>  
> Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup!  
>  
> One more time the vault lights up a carnival of paint  
> I endeavour to watch the panic but I worry that I will faint  
>  
> Floating fire  
> Golden wire  
> Silver trails  
> Flashing spire  
>  
> Guns are cracking  
> Bombs are smacking  
> Cat o' tails  
> Whips her lashings  
>  
> Lord of lightning's closer now  
> Our world's only rain and cloud  
> I'm not sure we have the power  
> Need to smite this evil down  
>  
> Lightning...  
>  
> Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yup!  
> Nonagon, nonagon...  
>  
> And from the lord's electric snare  
> One goes in his electric chair  
>  
> Lord of lightning shifts his gaze  
> Points his strong finger our way  
> Electricity escapes  
> Leaves destruction in our wake  
>  
> His electric trap was electric cyanide  
> The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried  
>  
> Lightning, yup!  
>  
> Nonagon, nonagon, nonagon infinity, yes!  
>  
> And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes  
> The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise  
>  
> Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight!  
> And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night
