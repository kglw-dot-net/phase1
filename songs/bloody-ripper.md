# Lyrics

> Push me down I will not crack   
> You're just a monkey with your claws in my back   
> I said it, and you heard   
> That murky bottle's cuttin' me some slack   
>    
> But it's like all I wanna do   
> Sink my teeth in you   
> You already told me to   
> You said it's alright
