# Lyrics

> I saw you in the carpet shades  
> Then I felt you like a baby's face  
> Just float along and fill your lungs  
> Float along and breathe a deep breath  
>  
> I saw you in the paper folds  
> And I saw you in my coffee mug  
> Just float along and fill your lungs  
> Float along and breathe a deep breath  
>  
> Just float along and fill your lungs  
> Just float along and fill your lungs  
> Just float along and breathe a deep breath  
> Just float along and fill your lungs
