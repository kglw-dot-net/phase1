# Lyrics

> Countdown  
> D-Day  
> I don't want to be late  
> For countdown  
> Distress  
> I don't want to make a mess  
>  
> When it all falls away  
> Clothes start to fray  
> Buildings decay  
> Rabble remain  
> Where they were green  
> Serility  
> Humanity  
> Staring at me  
>  
> Countdown  
> D-Day  
> I don't want to be late  
> For countdown  
> De-stress  
> I don't want to make a mess  
>  
> When it all falls away  
> Clouds start to fray  
> Buildings decay  
> Rabble remain  
> Where they were green  
> Sterility  
> Humanity  
> Staring at me
