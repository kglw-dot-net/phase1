# Lyrics

> Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert  
> Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert  
> Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert  
> Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress  
>  
> It's a misconcepted  
> Story from perspective  
> Lost in the barefoot desert  
>  
> Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert  
> Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert  
> Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert  
> Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress  
>  
> I stand here corrected  
> Misguided rejected  
> Lost in the barefoot desert  
>  
> So who am I to judge, too stubborn to budge  
> When I'm down here and you're way up above  
> Should've put some shoes on before I left the bus  
>  
> Now I've been neglected  
> I'm the last one stranded  
> Lost in the barefoot desert  
> Why can't I leave what's stopping me  
> From this prison  
> Straight jacket and shackles at my feet I'm grounded  
> Throw away the key for eternity  
> I'm desperate  
>  
> Lately I'm aware unprepared barefoot desert  
> Breathing down my neck unprepared barefoot desert  
> Never think ahead unprepared barefoot desert  
> Come on in if you dare to my capsule of stress
