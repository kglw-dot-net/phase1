# Lyrics

> The bad, white men call him the devil.  
> The Yavapai call him "Eyes Like the Sky."  
>  
> This story takes place in the hinterlands of the newly formed United States  
> And territories in the years before and after the great conflagration called the Civil War.  
> Men roam and fight each other to simply stay breathing.  
> Muskets give way to repeating rifles, cannons give way to Gatling guns.  
> War nurtures weapons, weapons clear the land.  
>  
> In the deserts of the southwest, old hatreds grow into new ones.  
> Old beliefs are shattered by gunfire and charging horses.  
> Into this cauldron of fire rides a young man who becomes a shadowed legend.  
> His name even takes on the mantle of the bogeyman in some homes.  
>  
> Among the first Americans, his name is exalted from wickiups to longhouses,  
> From teepees to cliff dwellings.  
> Among the men of the badlands, he is feared for his silent walk  
> And swift, economical dispatching of his enemies.
