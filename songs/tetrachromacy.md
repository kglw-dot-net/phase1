# Lyrics

> I heard a story, could be true  
> About a colour under blue  
> You couldn't see it with your eyes  
> Or invent with intellect  
>  
> Like the inverse of colourblindness  
> It's shrouded like a natural gas  
> I gotta see it for myself  
> Settle my own curiousness  
>  
> Back and forth swing like the tide  
> I look to left and to right  
> My three shades are divisible  
> Lust to see the invisible  
>  
> The story man was glassy-eyed  
> He told me 'bout the power lines  
> And in subarctic caribou eyes  
> The metal wires burst into life  
>  
> They flicker across the territory  
> Resplendent mackerel sky  
> Some of the snow absorbs UV  
> Unseeable crumbs in dye  
>  
> Picking up clues 'bout my eyes, I  
> Scrutinize the iris of the storm's eye  
> My three shades are divisible  
> Lust to see the invisible  
>  
> Tetrachromacy  
> See what I can't see  
> Tetrachromacy  
> See what I can't see  
>  
> Polygondwanaland  
>  
> Inconspicuous hue will be  
> Crowded camouflage to me  
> My three shades are divisible  
> Lust to see the invisible  
>  
> Tetrachromacy  
> See what I can't see  
> Tetrachromacy  
> See what I can't see
