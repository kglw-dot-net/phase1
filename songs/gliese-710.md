# Lyrics

> Melt the ice  
> Reheat the dead  
> Terraform the planet  
> Compress the lungs  
> Eat the mushroom  
> Cool the lava  
> Watch the new star dance upon the night sky  
> Fly my pretty silver lining  
> Wishful thinking  
> Strike defiant  
> Send your prayers for Gliese 710  
> Locked and loaded  
> Death descends  
>  
> Alien figures stumble sickly as their planet bakes  
> Constellations crumble quickly  
> On the horizon; cosmic waves  
> Shooting stars rain upon a distant planet  
> Hadron colliding  
> Forked lightning  
> Melting the cake's icing  
>  
> Fragmentation  
> New permutations  
> Needlepoint mutilations  
> Stick the fork in the powerpoint to be perturbed by revelations  
>  
> Freeze the water  
> Kill the living  
> Bake the planet  
> Suffocate the lungs  
> Grow the mushroom  
> Feed the volcano  
> Watch the new star dance upon the night sky  
>  
> Boil the water  
> Bury the dead  
> Destroy the planet  
> Collapse the lungs  
> Disintegrate the mushroom  
> Join the volcano  
> Be a cloud of gas upon the night sky
