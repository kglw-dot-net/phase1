# Lyrics

> It's always in between the lines you thought you read  
> The time and distance, keyhole, needle through the thread  
> I can't help but be sad sometimes  
> Talk to me see what's on my mind  
>  
> If I could step backwards somewhere into the past  
> I'd relive that great party where we had a blast  
> Pondering things in the past makes you blind  
> Look ahead you'll not waste your....  
>  
> Time mends furrowed brows  
> I can't help but thinking now  
> Back here I'll wait  
> Please don't let the past be my.... fate  
>  
> It takes two cats to enjoy a cool jamboree  
> It takes three to remember that one differently  
> Memory's a fog it gets thicker with time  
> Look at the clock its hands read the....  
>  
> Time mends furrowed brows  
> I can't help but thinking now  
> Back here I'll wait  
> Please don't let the past be my.... fate
