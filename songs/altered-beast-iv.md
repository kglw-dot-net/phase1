# Lyrics

> You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head  
> No love, no pain and no fear of dread  
>  
> Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort  
> And your savoir-faire is to kill for sport  
>  
> You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle  
> And lust to feel so bad that you'd force a giggle  
>  
> So crooked and curled is your point of view  
> There is no other creature more malicious than you  
>  
> I'm completely satisfied  
> My other life I will not miss  
> An altered beast until I die  
> And I will not give up on this  
> Never!  
>  
> True, I went to hell and back  
> But it was so I could be this  
> An altered beast until the end  
> And I will not give up on this  
> Never!  
>  
> I don't feel heinous, I  
> Don't feel no pain, I don't  
> Feel nothing, I don't feel  
> Anything, I don't feel  
> Heinous, I don't feel no  
> Pain, I don't feel nothing  
> I don't feel anything  
> Altered beast within me  
>  
> I don't feel heinous  
> I don't feel no pain  
> I don't feel nothing  
> I don't feel anything  
>  
> You're ruthless and savage and sadistic and vindictive  
> And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive  
>  
> But the longer you live and the longer you kill  
> There's a void that gets harder and harder to fill  
>  
> The void that you feel within would suggest  
> That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest  
>  
> And whatever you do there's no turning back  
> You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac  
>  
> Emptiness inside of me  
> And hollowness all around me  
> I cut myself to see it bleed  
> And now I don't feel anything  
> Never!  
>  
> Insincere and trivial  
> The world is void of all meaning  
> And gone is all that's visceral  
> And now I don't feel anything  
> Never!  
>  
> I don't feel heinous, I  
> Don't feel no pain, I don't  
> Feel nothing, I don't feel  
> Anything, I don't feel  
> Heinous, I don't feel no  
> Pain, I don't feel nothing  
> I don't feel anything  
> Altered beast within me  
> I don't feel heinous, I  
> Don't feel no pain, I don't  
> Feel nothing, I don't feel  
> Anything, I don't feel  
> Heinous, I don't feel no  
> Pain, I don't feel nothing  
> I don't feel anything  
> Altered beast within me  
>  
> I don't feel heinous  
> I don't feel no pain  
> I don't feel nothing  
> I don't feel anything  
>  
> The sole thing that will make your void obsolete  
> Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat  
>  
> Altered beast,  
> Alter me  
> Altered beast,  
> Alter me!  
>  
> I think I see  
> An altered beast  
> Inside me!  
>  
> I am an altered beast
