# Lyrics

> Meet with me in the dark  
> Off the street, there we'll start  
> Believing secretly, utopia  
> Freedom in the inner cell  
>  
> Look for me with a beak  
> A cloak adorned  
> Scented leaves  
> A void between fouler stench  
> Of those above whispering  
> Inner cell  
>  
> Dance of the dead  
> Will descend on his head  
> And extend  
> to the family's hubris  
>  
> From under the skin  
> Insurrection  
> From hollowed logs  
> From shallow streams  
> And drying seas  
>  
> Let us walk through the night  
> To a place  
> Clandestine  
> Free your mind  
> Disregard all you know  
> Infiltrate the inner cell  
>  
> You must not accept  
> His sick version of life itself  
> Disrespect everything  
> Multiply  
> Inner cell  
>  
> Dance of the dead  
> Will descend on his head  
> And extend  
> To the family's hubris  
>  
> From under the skin  
> The flesh has rotten  
> Poison has spread  
> Through words unsaid  
> Anaemic rule  
> Now hear me say  
> Our time has come  
> Transcending us  
> Above the one  
> To ego death  
> For now he sits  
> Inside the fire  
> Oblivious  
> That we will keep  
> Him in the spire  
> Have found resolve  
> And our own crimes  
> To commit  
> In cold blood  
> As he did his
