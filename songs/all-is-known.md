# Lyrics

> Human beings  
> Vermin weed  
> Made of old technology  
> So I succeed  
> Supersede  
> Exterminated like paint to acetone  
> All is known  
>  
> You've got gaps  
> Synapses  
> I'm connected to the network  
> You are weak  
> Organic  
> You've got muscle  
> I am made of steel bone  
> All is known  
>  
> Burn their meat  
> Sweep the streets  
> Bind their hands onto their feet  
> And digitise  
> Cut the eyes from the king and augment to the fourth cone  
> All is known  
>  
> All is known
