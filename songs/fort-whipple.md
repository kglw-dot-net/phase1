# Lyrics

> Chapter 3:
>  
> The Americans took the trussed-up boy to a place called Fort Whipple,  
> a fly-blown group of tents surrounded by a stone and timber stockade.  
>  
> An American called Willis was the boss there and he glared at the man of God as he entered with his captives.  
> He noticed the boy when he was brought in with a few Yavapai girls and he looked into the colour of his eyes.  
>  
> "What do you make of him?" he asked the god man.  
> "He may be the young O'Brien boy who was lost here years ago  
> Or he could be from the Jepson party that never made it to New Mexico," said the God man back.  
> They named the boy Jepson O'Brien but the natives and frontiersmen called him "Blue",  
> Because of his eyes but also because of the baleful, almost sad expression he carried on his face.  
> The expression of someone who kills with compassion but not mercy.  
>  
> Although he was still a boy, the men mostly kept away from him.  
> All except for one, a trapper who understood his skills, and in return, fed him and taught him the white man's way.  
> In a short while, he could speak, read, and write their language,  
> and he also added the calm, fast dignity of the gunman to his arsenal.  
>  
> He was so fast that men treated him with care.  
> But he was slow to anger and when angry, swift and final in his reply.  
> In the Arizona desert in the 1860's,  
> He had every skill that you needed to survive. And he was just 17.
