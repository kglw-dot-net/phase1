# Lyrics

> Dig-i-tal!  
>  
> Despondent, lugubrious, no future  
> We turned our bodies to computer  
> We are our own nature abuser  
>  
> No future!  
> Computer!  
> Abuser!  
>  
> I can tell every day I stay  
> All the whiteness turns to grey  
> All the grey to cimmerian  
> As the black is setting in  
>  
> Digital black  
>  
> We've sunken into our illusion  
> We've fashioned colossal confusion  
> I am the word of the last human  
>  
> Illusion!  
> Confusion!  
> Last human!  
>  
> I can see it all around the land  
> I can feel it with the back of my hand  
> I can hear a roaring silence  
> Of the murky caliginous  
>  
> I've heard the dark beast has said  
> That the world is like a brittle egg  
> He can crush it with only breath  
> And he can bring a black wave of death  
>  
> Digital black  
>  
> The last who feels the pain from the wound.  
> The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb.  
>  
> A wretched life in this altered place.  
> There must be more I can embrace.  
>  
> No future!  
> Computer!  
> Abuser!  
>  
> Digital black  
>  
> Illusion!  
> Confusion!  
> Last human!  
>  
> Digit, digit, digit  
>  
> I can tell every day I stay  
> All the whiteness turns to grey  
> All the grey to cimmerian  
> As the black is setting in  
>  
> Dig-i-tal...
