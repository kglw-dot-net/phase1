# Lyrics

> As soon as the dust settles you can see  
> A new world in place of where the old one had been  
>  
> Your skin is crawling with dry crusted mud  
> And your naked feet are wet in a pool of your blood  
>  
> And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud  
> That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud  
>  
> And as your eyes accommodate, there appears by the meadow  
> A brute like a bear with a long dark shadow  
>  
> And you violently shake over what you have seen  
> As you remembered the tale of the altered beast
