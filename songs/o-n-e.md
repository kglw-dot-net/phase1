# Lyrics

> One night everywhere.  
> One night everywhere.  
> One night everywhere...  
>  
> Dawn has reared its welcome head.  
> I lay in bed bravely waiting for the day to begin.  
>  
> Hours pass reading the news of the day that begins in such a state.  
> I bravely await fate.  
>  
> Am I going insane?  
> Am I able to wake from the nightmare?  
> Can I keep it contained?  
> One night everywhere turned to nowhere.  
>  
> Human race deserves its steaming fate on a plate.  
> We did exploit the fish of the sea and the birds  
> Of the Heavens and even the bugs in the ground  
> And every creeping thing that creeps on Earth.  
>  
> Am I going insane?  
> Am I able to wake from the nightmare?  
> Can I keep it contained?  
> One night everywhere turned to nowhere.
