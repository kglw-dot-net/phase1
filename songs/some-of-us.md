# Lyrics

> Ancient tombs like sand filled wombs of peoples life past.  
> Understand everything. Melted iron. Untold aeons.  
> Crafted demise. Destroying everything.  
>  
> Black sand timelines. Shifting skylines.  
> Faded guide signs revealing everything.  
> Ancient Thracians from lost nations.  
> Long gone people understand everything.  
>  
> Some, some of us see. Some, some of us don't.  
> Assured everything turns into dust.  
>  
> Rigor mortis fossil tortoise remains dormant underneath everything.  
> Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes.  
> Endless plague thus infecting everything.  
>  
> Sapien rituals born of mind tools.  
> Sects of false gods fade into everything.  
> Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes.  
> Ancient words thus foretelling everything.  
>  
> Some, some of us live. Some, some of us die.  
> Assured everything turns into dust.  
> Some, some of us live. Some, some of us die.  
> Assured everything turns into dust.
