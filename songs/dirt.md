# Lyrics

> Handshakes and bitter rows  
> Are the common conjecture  
> I can dissect anything  
> And save the skin for later  
>  
> I know its just a time  
> And things will get better  
> But I don't mind much anyway  
> Vampire reflection  
>  
> Gestured in our selfish understanding  
> Tensions only surface when you're hurt  
> Like a magpie's morning monologue  
> Whispers bending backwards in the dirt  
>  
> Make time to say you're right  
> You should already know this  
> With next to no pretension  
> Still I'm walking on egg shells  
>  
> Catch your breath I'm heading out  
> Be sure others will notice  
> This is just a product of  
> Lack of reflection  
>  
> Like a magpie's morning monologue  
> Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
