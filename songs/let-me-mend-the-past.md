# Lyrics

> Let me mend the past  
> Let me see behind your mask  
> You finally go around  
> She stares at the ground  
> And acts if you're not there  
>  
> Locks on the door  
> Surveillance when you enter in  
> The hall such a pointless cause  
> Her cups on my wall  
> It's hard to be ignored  
>  
> Let me mend the past  
> And make ends meet at last  
> Before they bleed  
> Don't wanna come across too weak  
>  
> Let me mend the past  
> Let me mend the past  
> This will be the last time I ask  
> Let me mend the past
