# Lyrics

> Galvanising uncertainty.  
> Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking.  
> Hierarchy it's been cracking aegis.  
> Embodied in this black heart shameless.  
>  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Like a blunder brewing full to the brim.  
> I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin.  
>  
> Cooking something raw. Cooking something big.  
> Pandemonium. Selfish pigs. Headless chickens scared shitless.  
> The media will never quit.  
>  
> Allegro fueled with discontent.  
> Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go.  
> Condescending expendables botched to a clock.  
> Novice to the dilemma with nothing clever left in stock.  
>  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending? Straws in the wind.  
> Is it all ending? Like a blunder brewing full to the brim.  
> I can hear Hell's kitchen and they're singing hymns.  
>  
> Cooking something raw. Cooking something big.  
> Pandemonium. Selfish pigs. Headless chickens scared shitless.  
> The media will never quit.  
>  
> The affluent with a bad omen hanging.  
> Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom.  
> Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude.  
> We are the pillars of a forgotten pier.  
>  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?...  
> Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?  
> Is it all, is it all straws in the wind?...  
>  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Like a slumber and we've all just awoken.  
> I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin.
>  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?  
> Straws in the wind. Is it all ending?...
