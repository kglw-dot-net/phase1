# Lyrics


> Hey, oh  
> I'm in jail  
> Body failed  
> Now it's me and my iron lung  
> Wrapped in iron  
> Deathless purgatory  
> Negative pressure  
> Airless breath  
> Wrapped in iron  
> Breathless purgatory  
> Positive pressure  
> Airless death  
>  
> It's a different kind of cuttlefish  
> Swing and a miss  
> Dancing with my eyes and lips  
> Can't move my hips  
> Keep my mind distracted from the swish-swish  
> Staying sane and positive  
> Can't crumble like a biscuit  
>  
> Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung...  
>  
> Space shuttle  
> Snail shell  
> Merry go round  
> Conveyor belt  
> The army tank ventilator  
> Mechanical bull respirator  
> Metallic cocoon boredom  
> Bionic boy  
> Pump my organs  
> Centre gravity  
> Planet me  
> Gimme the mushrooms  
> Time to leave  
>  
> Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung...  
>  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Neck paralysis  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
>  
> Scared precarious  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Neck paralysis  
> Congestion in my chest  
> Pins and needles like a voodoo evil  
> Got my doctor baffled  
> Every breath is an uphill battle  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Neck paralysis  
> Congestion in my chest  
>  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Neck paralysis  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Scared precarious  
> Frog breath  
> Steam tent  
> Neck paralysis  
> Sedated death  
>  
> Hey, oh  
> The ship sailed  
> Train derailed  
> Now it's me and my iron lung  
> Wrapped in iron  
> Deathless purgatory  
> Negative pressure  
> Airless breath  
> Wrapped in iron  
> Breathless purgatory  
> Positive pressure  
> Airless death  
>  
> It's a different kind of cuttlefish  
> Swing and a miss  
> Dancing with my eyes and lips  
> Can't move my hips  
> Gotta keep my mind distracted from the swish-swish  
> I'm staying sane and positive  
> Can't crumble like a biscuit  
>  
> Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung...  
>  
> Cylindrical prison  
> Newly arisen  
> Chained to a giant paper weight  
> Pain abates yet darkness permeates  
> Wallows my toes  
> Burdens my chest  
> My brain is pressed with an iron chest  
>  
> Iron lung. Iron lung. Iron lung...
