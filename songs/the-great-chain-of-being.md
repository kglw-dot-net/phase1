# Lyrics

> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
>  
> I am a rock with eyes to the sky  
> I wait for my time to arrive  
> I come to disturb the flow  
> Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat  
>  
> The great chain of being  
> Will fall to pieces in no time  
>  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
>  
> I usurp the precious stones  
> I have come to take the throne  
> I transcend the natural flesh  
> I will lay your God to rest  
>  
> The great chain of being  
> Will be unlinked to start again  
>  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
> The great chain of being  
>  
> I see through your world's facade  
> I decide to punish God  
> Rocky meteor sparks fire  
> Burn that God damn church to the ground  
>  
> I climb stairs to push you down  
> I climb chains to cut you down  
> I disrupt natural order  
> Bring that sulking lamb to slaughter
