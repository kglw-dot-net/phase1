# Lyrics

> Ya love. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love...  
>  
> I can't wait to be underneath ya spell.  
> I can't wait to spin the carousel.  
> I can't wait for ya to sweep us up.  
> I just can't wait to feel ya love.  
>  
> Ya love. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love...  
>  
> Ya love is just a state of mind in mine.  
> Are we here?  
> Don't know.  
> But I don't mind.  
>  
> I can't wait to go to some place with ya.  
> I can't wait to go on adventures.  
> I can't wait for us to pick ya up.  
> I just can't wait to feel ya love.  
>  
> Ya love. Ya love. Ya love. Ya love...  
>  
> Ya love is like a dream inside a dream.  
> Relax, close your eyes and be with me.  
>  
> I can't wait to be underneath ya spell.  
> I can't wait to spin the carousel.  
> I can't wait for ya to sweep us up.  
> I just can't wait to feel ya love.
