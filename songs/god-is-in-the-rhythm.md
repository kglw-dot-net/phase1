# Lyrics

> Earth by the moon  
> Darker days come soon  
> Owl sings a tune  
> Surely she knows too  
>  
> Bird is waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the rhythm  
>   
> Earth by the sun  
> Brighter days to run  
> Rain knows the sun  
> Knows it's not time to come  
>  
> Rain is waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the rhythm  
>  
> Seasons move  
> Everybody knows it's true  
> Spring brings a dew  
> Hibernates winters tune  
>  
> Summer's waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the seasons  
>  
> Trees know it too  
> The perfect time to bloom  
> The leaf asks the sun  
> Knows his time has come  
>  
> Leaf is waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the rhythm  
>  
> Wind blows a song  
> From the desert to the pond  
> Frog waves the wand  
> And the wind blows on beyond  
>  
> Frog is waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the rhythm  
>  
> Earth by the stars  
> We have all come from Mars  
> We all know it too  
> We belong to the soup  
>  
> We are waiting  
> Expectating  
> God is in the rhythm
