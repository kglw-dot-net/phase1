# Lyrics

> It's in vogue to be feckless  
> When it comes to the mother taking care of us  
> I know it's so conventional  
> But it don't make no sense at all  
>  
> But in fact it's a pattern  
> Everything I hear will always make me ashen  
> I know its recognisable  
> But it don't make no sense at all  
>  
> Ohhhh no no no sense at all  
>  
> People pay for their coupe  
> But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway  
> I know it's so predictable  
> But it don't make no sense at all  
>  
> And some people say it's on their radar  
> But they drive a million miles in their fast car  
> I know it's so invisible  
> But it don't make no sense at all  
>  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all  
>  
> But in fact it's a pattern  
> Everything I hear will always make me ashen  
> I know it's recognisable  
> But it don't make no sense at all  
>  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all  
> Ohhh no no no sense at all
