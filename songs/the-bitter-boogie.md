# Lyrics

> Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter...  
>  
> The bitter boogie comes without a warning  
> When it's inside of me it is exhausting  
> I don't like the way it makes me freeze up  
> And what it makes me say  
> I know it comes off bitter  
> Bitter  
> Bitter  
> But roll with it  
>  
> Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter...  
>  
> I wouldn't like to say I didn't warn ya  
> 'Cos bitter boogie comes without a warning  
> I really hate the way it mess my mind up  
> And all it makes me say  
> I know it comes off bitter  
> Bitter  
> Bitter  
> But roll with it  
>  
> From the first glance  
> Had no chance  
> Making exceptions  
> That would outlast  
> Searching for a new obsession  
> Yet I'm too bitter  
> To reconsider  
> My options twice  
> Before I ask for your advice  
>  
> Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter...  
>  
> I've been grieving for no reason  
> That seems wise  
> Married to the pipe  
> With no ambition besides  
> Yet I'm too bitter  
> To reconsider  
> My options twice  
> Before I ask for your advice  
>  
> Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter...
