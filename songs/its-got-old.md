# Lyrics

> I'm always saying I'm sorry  
> And you're always saying you're broke  
> I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel  
> If you keep your eyes on the road  
> But it's not like you anyway  
> To hide your sad face away  
> It ain't gonna stay the same  
> 'Cos it's got old  
> You'll always run me in circles  
> Chasing me round like a mouse  
> I'll keep on watching this movie  
> If it means I can stay at your house
