# Lyrics

> Exploding golden Sun  
> Bursting radiation  
> Get on your feet and run for the shelter  
> A change is gonna come  
> 8 minutes and 20 seconds  
> Over before begun  
>  
> And all that was green is fire and dust  
> And all that was blue has dried up  
> And all that we knew has dropped off the edge of waterfalls  
> What's after Armageddon?  
>  
> Giant star  
> A thousand tears  
> Liquid Moon  
> A billion years  
> Music of the brightest spheres  
> A gong for remodelled frontiers  
> Vibrates like the string of time  
> Dissonant storyline  
> The past and future intеrtwine  
> The sun explodеs at any time  
>  
> Exploding sun erupts  
> Causing deadly destruction  
> The time has come  
> Redux  
> Final endgame  
> A burning fireball  
> No more white dwarf  
> Our sins to be absolved  
>  
> And all that was green is fire and dust  
> And all that was blue has dried up  
> And all that we knew has dropped off of the edge of waterfalls  
> What's after Armageddon?  
>  
> Giant star  
> A thousand tears  
> Liquid moon  
> A billion years  
> Music of the brightest spheres  
> A gong for remodelled frontiers  
> Vibrates like the string of time  
> Dissonant storyline  
> The past and future intertwine  
> The sun explodes at any time  
>  
> The sun explodes at any time...
