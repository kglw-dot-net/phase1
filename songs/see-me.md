# Lyrics

> How can anybody see me when I am invisible and  
> How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible?  
> How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance?  
> How can every day I survive turn so easily to night?  
>  
> How can anybody see me?  
> I'm invisible.  
> How can anybody see me?  
> I'm a shadow here forevermore.  
>  
> How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person?  
> How on earth can someone like me be intangible to others?  
> How do all the people do the things that peoplе do around me?  
> How can anybody move when our planеt is suffocating?  
>  
> How can anybody see me?  
> I'm invisible.  
> How can anybody see me?  
> I'm a shadow here forevermore.
