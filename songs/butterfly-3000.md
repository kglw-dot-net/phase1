# Lyrics

> Butterfly 3000... Butterfly 3000...  
>  
> Hope that I am worthy of ya love.  
> Hope I am deserving of ya love.  
> Hope you can brush off the powers that be.  
> Hope I can empower femininity.  
> Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy.  
> Hope you don't let the world crush you,  
> For it is beautiful out there and there's a lot to see.  
> Hope I can teach you to see the splendour of the moment.  
> Hope you can see the beauty within the grim world's ugly mess.  
>  
> Butterfly 3000... Butterfly 3000...
