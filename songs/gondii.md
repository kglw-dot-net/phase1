# Lyrics

> Human being domesticated  
> Gondii's in the amygdala  
> Human being contaminated  
> Living-murdered feline worshiper  
>  
> What it feels like is it feels like it's dreamlike  
>  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself anymore  
>  
> What it feels like is it feels like it's dreamlike  
>  
> Human being manipulated  
> Gondii drizzles serotonin  
> Human being lubricated  
> Drowning in oxytocin  
>  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself anymorе  
> I've got oocysts inside my head  
> I can't control mysеlf  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself anymore  
>  
> So am I the bird or am I the worm?  
> Do have I free will?  
> Do have I free thought?  
>  
> Am I the chicken or am I the egg?  
> Have I liberty?  
> Have I my wings?  
>  
> You shouldn't fight it or deny it  
> Just breathe in and embrace it  
> Symbiotic Gondii choir sings a song of fuzzy minds  
>  
> So am I the dog or am I the cat?  
> No, it's neither one  
> I am the rat  
>  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself anymore  
> I've got oocysts inside my head  
> I can't control myself  
> Can't get a message to my brain  
> I can't control myself
