# Lyrics

> The young man by now was astride a horse and making for a Yavapai stronghold, half a day's ride away.  
> He had more guns and horses than he needed and he knew where two white men were sitting in the desert with no water and no horses.  
> White men dressed as Yavapai Apaches.  
>  
> The white men would be calling for their mothers and their God by evening.  
> The young man would be drunk on tiswin and full of deer meat. And satisfied by their agony.
