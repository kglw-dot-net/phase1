# Lyrics

> Any wasp I see  
> It's a fig wasp  
> Pearly guillotine  
> It's a fig wasp  
> And when the harvest's clean  
> There's a fig wasp  
> It's a winged machine  
> It's a fig wasp  
>  
> Any wasp I see  
> It's a fig wasp  
> Pearly guillotine  
> It's a fig wasp  
> And when the harvest's clean  
> There's a fig wasp  
> It's a winged machine  
> It's a fig wasp  
>  
> Does your god know  
> Insects grow  
> In my pome?  
>  
> Big fig wasp!  
>  
> Any wasp I see  
> It's a fig wasp  
> Pearly guillotine  
> It's a fig wasp  
> And when the harvest's clean  
> There's a fig wasp  
> It's a winged machine  
> It's a fig wasp  
>  
> Does your god know  
> Insects grow  
> In my pome?  
>  
> Big fig wasp!  
>  
> Any wasp I see  
> It's a fig wasp  
> Pearly guillotine  
> It's a fig wasp  
>  
> Big fig wasp!  
>  
> Ficain eating corpses  
> There's a hornet  
> In my throat!  
>  
> Big fig wasp!  
>  
> My body's overworked  
> It's just the same I know  
> When can my body work  
> Cold static overload  
> My body works I know  
> It's just the same I know  
> My only difference  
> Is robot influence  
>  
> I'm up here for the weirdo swarm  
> I'm the door when you come for more  
>  
> 1, 2, 3!  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
>  
> Wait for the answer to open the door  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door
