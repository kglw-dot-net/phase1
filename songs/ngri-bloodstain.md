# Lyrics

> Everyone thinks I am shallow  
> When I'm hiding in my room  
> Safe within my zone  
>  
> All the demons that I summon  
> Wipe the blood off of the floor  
> It's my only law  
>  
> Sorry!  
>  
> N-G  
> R-I  
> Mundane  
> Bloodstain  
> N-G  
> R-I  
> In my brain  
> Keep it clean  
> Bloodstain  
>  
> Bloodstain  
>  
> I've awoken from my slumber  
> I was dreaming 'bout a flood  
> Covered in my blood  
>  
> Now my pits are getting sweaty  
> It's a sign I've got to go  
> Back to where I know  
>  
> Sorry!  
>  
> Suffer endlessly  
> Suffer endlessly  
> Forever giving in to  
>  
> N-G  
> R-I  
> Mundane  
> Bloodstain  
> N-G-R-I  
> It's plain  
> Wipe it up  
> Bloodstain  
>  
> N-G  
> R-I  
> Mundane  
> Bloodstain  
> N-G  
> R-I  
> In my brain  
> Squeaky clean  
> Bloodstain  
>  
> Bloodstain
