# Lyrics

> Let me just introduce  
> You to my friend  
> Under the tree  
> The spider and me  
> All day weâ€™ll sit about  
> Giggling free  
> Under the tree  
> The spider and me  
>  
> The spider and me  
> The spider and me  
>  
> Laze in the sun  
> Gazing at  
> Each others beauty  
> The huntsman's heart forever beats  
> Our union is forever  
>  
> Love for my spider  
> Is nothing stranger  
> Than my admiring  
> Love of Nature  
> Am I a hippy if  
> I have this love?  
> We are the same stuff
