# Lyrics

> People-vultures  
> God approaches  
> Final hearing  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> People-vultures waiting to begin  
> Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin  
>  
> People-vultures waiting by my stage  
> Wild dogs escaping from their cage  
>  
> People-vultures  
> God approaches  
> Final hearing  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> People-vultures  
> God approaches  
> Final hearing  
> Disappearing  
> Tainted voodoo  
> Headless guru  
> Final head-spin  
>   
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> What else have I got left to spew down?  
>  
> People-vultures crowding at my door  
> Parasites are eating more and more
