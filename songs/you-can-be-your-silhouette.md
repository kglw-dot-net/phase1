# Lyrics

> When you make time  
> To clear the cobwebs off your mind  
> You may find yourself unwind  
> When all the ticking stops dead  
> You may find more time instead  
> And you can be your silhouette  
>  
> When you just stop  
> And take a look around your shop  
> You may feel your blues all drop  
> You can't sell your glum to me  
> But I can help you till you see  
> That you can be your silhouette  
>  
> It may be dark  
> It may be shadowy and stark  
> But don't be scared of what you've met  
> Your dance with it is no threat  
> In fact it is an asset  
> You can be your silhouette
