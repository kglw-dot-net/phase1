# Lyrics

> Who should we please?  
> Who's to believe?  
> Who should we change for?  
> Who could we be?  
> When my race is done, how did I run?  
> Did I par the course and pass the baton on?  
>  
> Vote with your feet  
> Make company  
> Form a military of peace and kill the king  
> Be a citizen of planet Earth  
> Be a bigger man or woman 'cause we all can change  
>  
> Change  
> Change  
>  
> Change for its own sake  
> Uniformity gave me a belly ache  
> I want a mutiny  
> My mind is finally awake  
> Who could we be given equal opportunity?  
> What could we see given equal chance to actually see change?  
>  
> Change  
> Change  
>  
> Is this what we consider changing for the better?  
> Maybe  
>  
> Is this what we consider changing?  
> Ah, save me  
> Is this what we consider changing for the better?   
> Maybe  
> Is this what we consider changing?  
>  
> I'm changing  
> I'm changing  
> Is this what we consider changing for the better?  
> Maybe  
> Is this what we consider changing?  
> Change  
>  
> Is this what we consider changing?  
> I'm changing  
> I'm changing  
> Is this what we consider changing?  
>  
> We're changing pace  
> Higher stakes 
> So called heroes wearing fake capes  
> Critically acclaimed  
> Clinically deranged  
> Push the buttons  
> Keep on frontin' 'til they hear the thumpin'  
> Something's coming up the hallway out of the left field lane  
> Hey  
> My stomach's turning from the vermin up-skirt observing power hungry  
> Tryna draw the curtains from the public person  
> But there ain't no slicker villain that's deserving a serving on the killing floor  
> Put 'em on the chopping board for all to see  
>  
> I'm like a sniper hiding in the tower  
> I'm picking them off one by one  
> Gateway drug to the only solution  
> Cutting out their tongues before they jump the gun  
> I'm the like the cupid trying bring the love but you keep getting out of my range  
> No strings on my bow with broken arrows  
> Running low on ammo to make a change  
>  
> Buildings that you know  
> People come and go  
> Are a certain way  
> Always are the same  
> And then you get the news that obliterates your view  
> Amputate your truths  
> The significance has changed  
>  
> Hospital inane  
> Meaningless and grey  
> But lie within the walls and the significance will change  
> What would it take for us to change the game?  
> Maybe our existence is significance in vain  
> The significance has changed  
> Maybe our existence is significance in vain  
>  
> Buildings that you know  
> People come and go  
> Are a certain way  
> Always are the same  
> And then you get the news that obliterates your view  
> Amputate your truths  
> The significance has changed  
>  
> Hospital inane  
> Meaningless and grey  
> But lie within the walls and the significance will change  
> What would it take for us to change the game?  
> Maybe our existence is significance in vain  
>  
> What would it take to build an ark for me and my friends?  
> Escape this old place with all that creeps and fish in the sea  
> And all that flies and all the bugs inside of me  
> Take all the good things and leave the human beings  
>  
> Da da da da da da da da  
>  
> Burnin' up  
> Burnin' up  
> Burnin' up  
> Burnin' up now  
>  
> Change  
> Change
