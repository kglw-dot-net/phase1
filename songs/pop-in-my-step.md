# Lyrics

> Gonna shake the world, shake the world off my back  
> I'm gonna hold my head high with the sun on my track  
> Today I've got no troubles in sight  
>  
> Gonna put some pop in my step when I walk  
> I'm gonna show my mood off when I walk and I talk  
> Today I've got no troubles in sight  
> Gonna turn around make everything that was wrong into right  
>  
> Gonna look past things that I know I'll regret  
> Cause life's a little too short for those worries, you can bet on me  
> Today I've got no troubles in sight  
> Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into....  
> Right, right  
>  
> When I wake up late in the morning you'll know  
> It takes a few more hours before I'll know  
> Today I've got no troubles in sight  
> Gonna turn around make everything that was wrong into....  
> Right, right, right, right
