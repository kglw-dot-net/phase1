# Lyrics

> Most of what I like  
> Is given to me by  
> The one that I love  
> Bears the onus every time  
>  
> Technically I don't deserve to live this kind of life  
> Perturbed at what I might become  
> Unchanging every time  
>  
> Ecstasy is what I'm needing  
> I'm bleeding from the eyes  
> You always shut your eyes  
> When you look me in the eyes  
>  
> Always caressing  
> The ropes which I've frayed  
> The corpse that I'm dressing  
> Should never be displayed  
>  
> Face to face is nice  
> But sharper than a knife  
> I teeter on it's edge  
> Just waiting to be sliced  
> Returning home brain dead  
> And you inject the life  
> Appeal to me love  
> Remake, rebuild, revise  
>  
> Restavit is what I'm bleeding  
> A laxative to cry  
> You always shut your eyes  
> When you look me in the eyes  
>  
> Always caressing  
> The ropes which I've frayed  
> The corpse that I'm dressing  
> Should never be displayed
