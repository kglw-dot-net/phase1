# Lyrics

> Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. I feel so sorry for fishies.  
> It seems like cruelty to me. You ain't hungry: leave them be.  
>  
> I don't want to be fishing for fish. I just want to let them freely swim.  
> I don't want to be fishing for fish. I just want to let them freely swim.  
>  
> Oh your hearts a hook. Ego tied in knots; baiting fate.  
> Don't do it; You ain't a god. Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod.  
> Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. I feel so sorry for fishies.  
> Don't matter to kiss and put back. Poor fishies should be free.  
>  
> I don't want to be fishing for fish. I just want to let them freely swim.  
> I don't want to be fishing for fish. I just want to let them freely swim.  
>  
> Oh your hearts a hook. Ego tied in knots; baiting fate.  
> Don't do it; You ain't a god. Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod.  
>  
> Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. I feel so sorry for fishies.  
> Fishing for fishies don't make them feel happy or me neither. I feel so sorry for fishies.  
>  
> I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none.  
> I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none.  
>  
> I've let them swum. I've let them swum. I've let them swum. I've let them swum.  
>  
> I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none.  
> I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none. I have been fishing and I don't want to catch none.
