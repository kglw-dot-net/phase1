# Lyrics

> Ice V. Ice V. Ice V...  
>  
> Ganymede princess with the tongue of death  
> She smells what the wind says with the lava forked pincers  
> Ganymede princess with a lungless chest  
> With her tongues forked pincers she smells what the people says  
>  
> Ice V. Ice V. Ice V...  
>  
> Monoclinic  
> Crystalline  
> Spears of death shoot down the line  
> Autocratic and quantised  
> Land mine meteorite  
> Lost in transit  
> Obliteration  
> Disconnected correlations  
> Lucky 7  
> Ace of spades  
> Double down  
> Checkmate  
>  
> Ice V. Ice V. Ice V...  
>  
> Ain't getting out of here alive  
> Ice V has arrived  
>  
> Pimple puss  
> Crop circle pit  
> Oozing out of crevices  
> Sentient toadstool throne  
> Crooked sceptre  
> Alien bone  
> Frosted pistol  
> Loaded spite  
> Shooting rays of frozen light  
> Feel the doom of flashing flood  
> Crimson clouds are raining blood  
>  
> Will we survive Ice V?  
>  
> Ice V. Ice V. Ice V...  
>  
> Queen of ice  
> Suffice to say  
> Engulfing all in crystal dismay  
> Freezing whims as the sun dims  
> The pressure tearing limb from limb  
> Earth born cities stripped away  
> As the ice queen hypnotically sways  
> Queen of ice  
> Suffice to say  
> Engulfing all in crystal dismay  
>  
> Ice V. Ice V. Ice V...  
>  
> Ain't getting out of here alive  
> Ice V has arrived
