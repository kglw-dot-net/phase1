# Lyrics

> It's hot  
> It's mean  
> Summer to me  
> Green grass won't last  
> Sky blue  
> Me too  
> Helicopter  
> Flying over  
> Shark bait  
> Shark bite  
> Cover up  
> Sunburn  
> Leather skin  
> Heatstroke  
>  
> Make the dash across the amber coals to meet the sea  
> So cold it freezes me  
> My teeth are chattering  
> Give me over to the river  
> My place that loves me  
> Gum leaves and tea trees  
> The river is immortal  
>  
> I'm parched  
> I'll cark  
> The salty spray arrests  
> No amount of bottled water could bottle the stress  
> I think I'll stop breathing and sink  
> I'm a boy  
> I'm not a buoy  
> I'm paralysed  
> I'm paranoid  
> Out of my element  
>  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water  
>  
> It's hot  
> It's mean  
> The beach to me  
> Green grass won't grow  
> Sky blue  
> Me too  
> I don't care for cricket  
> And I don't care for waves  
> And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays  
>  
> So I will jump into the river when you jump into the sea  
> And feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet  
> I'll lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree  
> And let the muscle men on the beach bask in vanity  
>  
> I shall choose this life for me, any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway  
>  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water  
> I prefer the muddy water
