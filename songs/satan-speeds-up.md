# Lyrics

> You brought us to your gift of generosity  
> And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils  
> When I stop to think of all that  
>  
> Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung  
> When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils  
> When I stop to think of all that we've done  
> Satan's at the door  
>  
> Every second, every minute, every hour, every day  
> He's watching you  
> and passing judgement to everybody you hold dear  
> When I stop to think of all that we've done  
> Satan's at the door  
> Who's he looking for?
