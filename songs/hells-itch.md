# Lyrics

> Flick the switch  
> Hell's itch  
> Derma-glitch  
> Hell's itch  
> Bewitched  
> Hell's itch  
> Perpetual twitch  
> Hell's itch  
>  
> Why, why, why when my nail glides through my epidermis does it feel so joyous?  
> The deeper the cut  
> The thicker the blood  
> Subcutaneous fat feels good like that  
> Dancing beneath my wafer-thin crust  
> Teasing me  
> Taunting me  
> My unquenchable lust  
> If I only could locate this bug  
> Oozing under like a slug  
> I'd slice my skin to get within  
> Lacerate my own linchpin  
> Nominate my next of kin  
> Destroy myself with no chagrin  
> Find the source of this deep remorse  
> Buried deep inside me like a sunken horse  
> ooted below in the innermost abyss is a fathomless unscratchable itch  
>  
> Shed my skin if need be to suppress the itch for it would fill me with glee  
> Whatever is this persistent yearn to rip off my skin and stop the burn?  
> Crawling tender temptations  
> Catacombs beneath the layers of hatching eggs  
> Thunder threads  
> Claws enthralled in pitted keratosis  
> Lacerations peeling paper-thin  
> Barbecue skin  
> Deeper burying  
>  
> Flick the switch  
> Hell's itch  
> Derma-glitch  
> Hell's itch  
> Bewitched  
> Hell's itch  
> Perpetual twitch  
> Hell's itch  
> Rising pitch  
> Hell's itch  
> Latent witch  
> Hell's itch  
> Grisly sitch  
> Hell's itch  
> The old adage: Pain is easier to endure than an itch  
>  
> Shed my skin if it need be  
> To suppress the itch would fill me with glee  
> Whatever is this persistent yearning to rip off my skin and stop the burning  
> Crawling tender temptations  
> Catacombs beneath the layers of hatching eggs  
> Thunder threads  
> Claws enthralled in pitted keratosis  
> Lacerations peeling paper-thin  
> Barbecue skin  
> Deeper burying  
>  
> Flick the switch  
> Hell's itch  
> Derma-glitch  
> Hell's itch  
> Bewitched  
> Hell's itch  
> Perpetual twitch  
> Hell's itch  
>  
> Let the sun burn  
> Oh, my cells gurn  
> When the skin drips I sing the hell's itch  
> Deep in the compost  
> Believe that the worm can still see the light  
> Sing the hell's itch  
> I sleep with the rat who's kiss has set me free  
> Oh, I sing  
> Oh, I sing the hell's itch  
> Prick the ceramic  
> Bodily condom be gone  
> Oh, baby please be gone  
> The breeze on my flesh feels so fuckin' good  
> Look at me now, Helen  
> Yeah, I'm finally red  
> Yeah, I'm finally red  
>  
> Why, why, why when my nail glides through my epidermis does it feel so joyous?  
> The deeper the cut  
> The thicker the blood  
> Subcutaneous fat hurts good like that  
> Dancing beneath my wafer-thin crust  
> Teasing me  
> Taunting me  
> My unquenchable lust  
> If only I could locate this bug  
> Oozing under like a slug  
> I'd slice my skin to get within  
> Lacerate my own linchpin  
> Nominate my next of kin  
> Destroy myself with no chagrin  
> Find the source of this deep remorse  
> Buried deep inside me like a sunken horse  
> Rooted below in the innermost abyss is a fathomless unscratchable itch
