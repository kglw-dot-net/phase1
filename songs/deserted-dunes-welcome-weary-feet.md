# Lyrics

> Deserted dunes  
> Welcome weary feet  
> Feel euphoric  
> Polygondwanaland  
> And so novel  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Prehistoric  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Living fossil  
> Polygondwanaland  
> It's full of dinosaurs  
>  
> Nervous natives  
> Watch pompous pilgrims  
> Foreign nature  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Eerie jungle  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Our bodies are  
> Polygondwanaland  
> Tasty morsels  
> Polygondwanaland  
> It's full of dinosaurs
