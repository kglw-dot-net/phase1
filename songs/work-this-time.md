# Lyrics

> I knock hello but I see that you've got hypothermia  
> So I place a block to stop the rot and hope that I can warm you up  
> Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind?  
> Cause every light bulbs' blown and I'm feeling so inclined  
> Can never lay my whole head down  
> I know I'm lazy but baby I will work this time  
> It's kind of funny that I live the poetry I can not write  
> But you my beauty shall be fixed forever loosely in my heart
