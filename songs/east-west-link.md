# Lyrics

> All the highways. Like terminal airways.  
> All the highways. Like sapien DNA.  
>  
> We can build a road.  
> We can cut a tree.  
> We can shoot a bird.  
> Nobody will see.  
>  
> All the highways. Like terminal airways.  
> All the highways. Like sapien DNA.  
>  
> Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld.  
> Never wanna get up. Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world.  
>  
> We can kill the worms underneath the trees.  
> We can tunnel in.  
> Nobody will see.  
>  
> All the highways. Like terminal airways.  
> All the highways. Like sapien DNA.  
>  
> Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld.  
> Never wanna get up. Never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world.
