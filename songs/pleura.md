# Lyrics

> Bone stock brewed up. Graveyard shoot up.  
> Came in trapdoor. Thrown up on the floor.  
> Servants of the lord of lung slaughter.  
> The necromancer.  
>  
> Orange baby always squealing.  
> Cradle snatch the new world fading.  
> The final test, it takes your breath.  
> Desecrates our grave.  
>  
> Drink the blood of that you spill.  
> Underneath the whippoorwill.  
> One more piece of Jenga to pull.  
> Then necromancer will thank us all.  
>  
> Eager to assimilate and I choose you to walk on your pleura.  
>  
> Drink the blood of that you spill.  
> Underneath the whippoorwill.  
> One more piece of Jenga to pull.  
> Then necromancer will thank us all.  
> Suck the life from what you love.  
> I learnt that from the orange one.  
> No one to answer to after the fall.  
> Necromancer will dance on us all.  
> Drink the blood of that you spill.  
> Underneath the whippoorwill.  
> One more piece of Jenga to pull.  
> Then necromancer will thank us all.  
>  
> Pleura. Pleura. Pleura...  
>  
> Eager to assimilate.  
> And I choose you to walk on your pleura.  
> Cheat me out of living my life?  
> I exercise my right to die.
