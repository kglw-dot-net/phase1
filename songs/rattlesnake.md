# Lyrics

> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattles me  
>  
> Isolation  
> Trepidation  
> Don't fear nothing  
> Snake is bluffing  
> Whips his tail  
> Sends you running  
>  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattles me  
>  
> Vegetation  
> Aggravation  
> Found him hiding  
> Snake is smiling  
> Whips his tail  
> Leaves you riling  
>  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattles me  
>  
> Rattle, rattle, rattle...  
>  
> Hibernation  
> Altercation  
> Don't get angry  
> Snake is cranky  
> Whips his tail  
> In a frenzy  
>  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattles me  
>  
> Rattle, rattle, rattle...  
>  
> I'm the serpent  
> Devils servant  
> Time to meet your end  
>  
> Fangs are ready for the strike  
> Deadly razor sharp  
> Poison with a single spike  
> While you're immobile  
>  
> Screaming like a maniac  
> After my attack  
> Crying like a baby child  
> In exile  
>  
> Sweat drips out of every pore  
> As I bite you more and more and more and  
> Take one last look at your captor  
> And hear my tail  
> Rattling 'till you're death  
>  
> Rattling 'till you're death  
>  
> Rattle, rattle, rattle...  
>  
> Rattle, rattle, rattle...  
>  
> I'm the serpent  
> Devils servant  
> Time your meet your end  
>  
> Fangs are ready for the strike  
> Deadly razor sharp  
> Poison with a single spike  
> While you're immobile  
>  
> Screaming like a maniac  
> After my attack  
> Crying like a baby child  
> In exile  
>  
> Sweat drips out of every pore as  
> I bite you more and more and more and  
> Take one last look at your captor  
> And hear my tail  
> Rattling 'till you're death  
>  
> Rattling 'till you're death  
> 
> Rattle, rattle, rattle...  
>  
> Isolation  
> Trepidation  
> Don't fear nothing  
> Snake is bluffing  
> Whips his tail  
> Sends you running  
>  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattlesnake  
> Rattles me
