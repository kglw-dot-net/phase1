# Lyrics

> Are you you? Are you me?  
> Or someone in between?  
> You lost track inside the labyrinthine  
>  
> You lost your will and your sanity  
> You certainly lost your humanity  
>  
> In life you have taken much more than your worth  
> Now it's your turn to give back to the earth  
>  
> May you return to the ground and ossify  
> It's time for you to die, die, die
