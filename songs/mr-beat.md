# Lyrics

> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
>  
> Latent gun beamed for my head  
> It's a wonder that I tread  
> Over worn ground through my youth  
> Making all my dreams come true  
>  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
>  
> Happy days seem so absurd  
> Lightning that's unlikely heard  
> Nova sunshine while I nap  
> Making all my dreams so sad  
>  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
>  
> Don't miss the bar we play here  
> Already ringing in my ears  
> Don't miss the bar it's right here  
> Only a beat disappears  
>  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
>  
> Only miss a beat  
> Only miss a beat  
> Only miss a beat  
> Only miss a beat  
>  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat - only miss a beat  
> Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
