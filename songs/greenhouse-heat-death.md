# Lyrics

> Heat death  
> Bake rot  
> Torrid  
> Char crop  
> Heat death  
> Hard yolk  
> See flames  
> Smell smoke  
>  
> My house is green  
> You know what I mean  
> My house was blue  
> It cooked right through  
>  
> Come meet me inside  
> Greenhouse we will fry  
>  
> Heat death  
> Hormones  
> Good broth  
> Cook bones  
>  
> My house is fried  
> All life has died  
> My house was blue  
> Beautiful too  
>  
> Come meet me inside  
> Greenhouse we will die  
>  
> Heat death  
> Bake rot  
> Torrid  
> Char crop  
> Heat death  
> Hard yolk  
> See flames  
> Smell smoke  
>  
> Come meet me inside  
> Greenhouse we will die  
> My house is green
