# Lyrics

> There is a secret I've been keeping, a story true and genuine  
> And I have not the candid heart to keep its burden clandestine  
>  
> For its gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow  
> And its memory repeats inside of me ostinato  
>  
> And every time I think of the poor lot I recall  
> The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all  
>  
> I saw death become of light and life become of fire  
> I saw it from my hiding place within the quagmire  
>  
> I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged and unignored  
> The battle of the Balrog and the mighty lightning lord
