# Lyrics

> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I'm an automatic transmission.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I hold the pole position.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
>  
> No want for gas - I run on love.  
> So cut the brakes.  
> There's no end of the road.  
> Unfading highway.  
> Pass no cars on the way.  
> So set to cruise.  
> Let's get away.  
>  
> Let's drive.  
> Drive, drive, drive.  
> Let's drive.  
> Drive, drive, drive, drive.  
>  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I'm an automatic transmission.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I hold the pole position.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
>  
> Yeh I go the distance.  
> Yeh I go the distance.  
> Yeh I go the distance.  
>  
> I think I went too fast.  
> You did.  
> I think the car might crash.  
> It will.  
> I'll have to pull out the wings and feel the lift underfoot.  
> I'm shaking with fear.  
> Such a crazy idea.  
> Better give it a try.  
> See if this car can fly.  
>  
> Let's fly.  
> Fly, fly, fly.  
> Let's fly.  
> Fly, fly, fly, fly.  
>  
> I'm flying.  
> I'm floating.  
> I'm flying.  
> I'm floating.  
>  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Keep pushing like the Ford motor pistons.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I'm an automatic transmission.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> I hold the pole position.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.  
> Ohh baby I got persistence.  
> Yeah I go the distance.
