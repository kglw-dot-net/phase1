# Lyrics

> They were not after the money, they were not after alcohol.  
> They were after guns and young children to raise as their own.  
> War had made it necessary to take child captives.  
> The rest would be slaughtered.  
> And that is how Miguel O'Brien became a Yavapai-Apache warrior.  
> He was five years old.
