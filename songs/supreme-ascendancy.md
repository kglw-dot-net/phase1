# Lyrics

> How can you get away with a murder  
> Scot-free when you're found guilty in the first degree?
> It's pretty simple when you're so powerful.  
> It's who ya know. Untouchable. Lying through your teeth.  
> Break the doctrine. They're all laughing. Double parking.   
> Tax-free control monopoly. So complacent.  
> It's adjacent to the demons you summon from your faculty.  
>  
> Supreme ascendancy. Tomfoolery.  
> You're not above the law. No matter your beliefs.  
> Supreme ascendancy. Tomfoolery.  
> You're not above the law. No matter your beliefs.  
>  
> Supreme ascendancy. Supreme ascendancy. Supreme ascendancy...  
>  
> Satan in a cassock casting black magic.  
> Childhoods tragically ripped from their shaking feet.  
> Conscious yet inadequate. The bullshit catalyst.  
> Far flung inaction by the ministry of presbytery.  
>  
> Supreme ascendancy. Tomfoolery.  
> You're not above the law. No matter your beliefs.  
> Supreme ascendancy. Tomfoolery.  
> You're not above the law. No matter your beliefs.  
> Supreme ascendancy. Tomfoolery.  
> Holy hands of God. Justice impedes.  
>  
> Supreme ascendancy. Supreme ascendancy.  
> Supreme ascendancy. Permanent purgatory.
