# Lyrics

> Like a red herring  
> Laminated denim  
> A note outside the scale from beyond the pale  
> Unwitting host  
> Inside-out ghost  
> Harbinger of changes  
> Destiny exchanges  
> Time slows  
> Eyes close  
> In crimson tubes the pressure grows  
> Sticky red death  
> Life theft  
> Hypertension is all that's left  
>  
> Golden hour turns to pink vein wine light  
> Satan's son  
> Fowl one  
> Demon of time  
> Bat wing membrane eclipsed the sun for fun  
>  
> Generation ferry  
> Laminated denim  
> Rotate anti-clockwise and see through backward facing eyes  
> Feel its allure  
> History jeweller  
> Stumbled on its ladder and eaten by its chasm  
> Then your mind slows  
> Stress grows  
> In crimson tubes the pressure grows  
> Sticky red death  
> Life theft  
> Hypertension is all that's left  
>  
> Who am I if not the canary in the coal mine?  
> I won't be back  
> I slipped and fell into its lap  
> Innards boil inside my tracts  
>  
> I caught that hypertension in another dimension  
> Inside my time invention, I've laminated denim  
>  
> I caught that hypertension in another dimension  
> Inside my time invention, I've laminated denim
