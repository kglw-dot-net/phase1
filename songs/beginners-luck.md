# Lyrics

> Join me at the table  
> If you'd like to place a bet  
> All the cash that's filling your pockets  
> Is waiting to be spent  
> I know you've never played but  
> Drinks are free, it's so bizarre  
> Even if you loose a few chips it's  
> Cheaper than the bar  
>  
> Beginner's luck is on your side  
> You've got dollar signs inside your eyes  
>  
> The beginner's luck  
> Now don't mess it up  
> If you get too stuck just bluff  
> The beginner's luck is tough  
>  
> The king extends his hand  
> He looks into my palm  
> I don't know if he wants to shake it  
> Or cut it from my arm  
> The dealer sits washing  
> All the burn cards from the deck  
> I think he might be trying to clean them  
> But I'd have to double-check  
>  
> Beginner's luck is on your side  
> You've got dollar signs inside your eyes  
>  
> The beginner's luck  
> Now don't mess it up  
> If you get too stuck just bluff  
> The beginner's luck is tough  
>  
> All your money's scared  
> And you're down to betting skins  
> But have you heard of a trick called spooking?  
> It'll help you win  
> But tricks are just for children  
> And cheating is a sin  
> And now you're down to the felt on the table  
> And security's moving in  
>  
> Beginner's luck of course backfired  
> Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky  
>  
> The beginner's luck  
> Now don't mess it up  
> The beginner's luck  
> Now don't mess it up  
> The beginner's luck  
> Now don't mess it up  
> If you get too stuck just bluff  
> The beginner's luck is tough
