# Lyrics

> Join the last migration. It's fun. Fuck the system.  
> Your new best mate is great. King of a bald primate.  
> We are not worthy of our heir's glory.  
> Mental rotation for the overlord.  
>  
> Super-organism caused a schism bending light through prisms.  
> Cyber-surgeon. JavaScript person. Digital cleanse.  
> Tell all your friends the neural network's at work.  
>  
> Automation. Automation. Automation...  
>  
> Prepare for mutation because after all I'm sure I heard the crack of doom.  
> Death kiss. Everyone should be talking 'bout this.  
> Human karma dinosaur inside a simulation.  
> Automation.  
>  
> Automation. Automation. Automation...
