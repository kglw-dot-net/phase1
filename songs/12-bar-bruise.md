# Lyrics

> Better be slave   
> Make some money   
> So when it gets ruff   
> We can bruise some stuff   
>    
> But look at my dick   
> I bet you it’s limp   
> Should I quit drink   
> It makes me think that…   
>    
> 12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise   
>    
> Gotta be strong   
> Make me live long   
> Better not wait   
> For a bottle’s sake   
>    
> All of my friends are   
> Looking up dresses   
> They have not seen   
> The bruise that I’ve seen   
> Broo-oo-oo-oo-uize
