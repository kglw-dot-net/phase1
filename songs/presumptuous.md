# Lyrics

> So presumptuous.  
> With tongue in cheek.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Belittle me.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Falling at your feet.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Don't agree with your negativity.  
>  
> Eggshell landmine stepping stones.  
> Kindred spirits at a crossroads.  
> The world we built is on a tilt.  
> Bottled up inside and filled with guilt.  
> Maybe you've got a god complex.  
> Missing in action, didn't even notice.  
> Sounds like negligence.  
> Featherless, shaking in defense.  
>  
> So presumptuous.  
> With tongue in cheek.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Belittle me.  
>  
> Sitting duck light bulb revelation.  
> We're losing momentum.  
> BlasÃ©, naive sheepishly brazen.  
> You're doing the bare minimum.  
>  
> So presumptuous.  
> With tongue in cheek.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Belittle me.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Falling at your feet.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Letting go unwillingly.  
>  
> So presumptuous.  
> With tongue in cheek.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Belittle me.  
> So presumptuous.  
> Falling at your feet.  
> So presumptuous.  
> What's it gonna take for you to see that.  
>  
> Shrug your shoulders.  
> No response.  
> It's become a known nuisance.  
> You took for granted all our trust.  
> And threw it all away.  
> So presumptuous.
