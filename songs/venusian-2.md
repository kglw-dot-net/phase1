# Lyrics

> In the lap of the gods, the last one did explode in a blaze all firey.  
> I sit in the cockpit. It may be a sinking ship but fortune favours bravery.  
> Road trip with me. Vitamin V in focus now.  
>  
> Venusian 2. Venusian 2.  
>  
> Fingers getting warm and eyes are turning gold.  
> Evil twin is coming in. Weathering the storm, I put the birdie down.  
> For the sin I have a grin. Road trip with me.  
> Vitamin V. I see the ground.  
>  
> Venusian 2. Venusian 2. Venusian 2. Venusian 2.
