# Lyrics

> Who? He!  
> Sleepwalker  
> Well I want to, I want to, I want to  
> I want to walk in your shoes  
> Oh No!  
> Who? He!  
> Sleepwalker  
> Ooh, ooh, hee, hee, hee  
> Well I want to, I want to, I want to  
> I want to sleepwalk with you  
> Oh No!  
> I caught you sleeping on the wrong side of the bed  
> So I got up and switched my side  
> Your voice gets hoarse when you get too cold  
> I'll warm you up  
> If you're thinking then you're thinking too hard  
> So squish your brain and numb your pain
