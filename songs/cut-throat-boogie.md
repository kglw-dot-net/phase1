# Lyrics

> As a child I felt inclined   
> To fold my ears in twine   
> Never once was I confined   
> I picked and choosed about my ride   
> So buckle me in before we set sail ahead   
> For it smells like cabbage   
> Got way too stale like death   
>    
> Oh you’re white as a ghost   
> I never felt so pale   
> As the blood dripped across the floor   
>    
> So put it buried in your chest   
> With the rest of your drunken regrets   
> Inches from your jugular   
> As the room fills in front of ya   
> It took them long enough   
> For them to stop and suggest   
> Hey we better get him some help   
> We better get him out of here   
>    
> How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked   
> Through my clothes and to the floor   
> From outside to the bathroom door   
> I was inches from my life   
> Yeah that’s what keeps me up at night   
>    
> Oh how did I survive / you shoulda died   
> How did I manage to cope / being alive   
> After all it was just a / innocent play fight   
> I hope they don’t stop to sympathise   
>    
> Stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart   
>    
> Tormented dreams it’s all left in between...
