# Lyrics

> I see all there is and has ever been  
> I am not a man; I am everything  
> Picture of purity  
>  
> Deific reign  
> Ordained unto me  
> Prehistoric god  
> Theophany  
> I shall not be moved  
> Those who try  
> I will drink their blood  
>  
> I'll be watching them  
> I am everywhere  
> Floating on the wind  
> Hiding in the dark  
> Pure omniscience  
> Traitors will all quake  
> At the thought of me  
> Hang them on a hook  
> Put them on display  
> Examples must be made  
>  
> This is a test, I am lord  
> Fear my wrath  
> This is a test, I am lord  
> I am death  
>  
> What is with these  
> Crimes of treason?  
> I will fight this inquisition  
> If I have to I will not surrender  
> If I'm backed into a corner  
> I will draw and quarter  
> All their children  
> Just to prove I'm not a coward  
> I will put them all on Judas Cradle  
> Just to show them a god incarnate  
>  
> Where's the loyalty?  
> Where's their loyalty?  
> Where's the loyalty?  
> Where's their loyalty?  
> No man - No problem
