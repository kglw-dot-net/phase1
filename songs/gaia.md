# Lyrics

> I.  
> I am the one.  
> I am the none.  
> I am nobody.  
> I am no one.  
> I am god.  
> I am you.  
> I am me.  
> I am Gaia.  
>  
> Giant body parasite.  
> Gaia lives while others die.  
> I.  
> I am the two.  
> I am you too.  
> I am the stream.  
> I am wind.  
> I am rain.  
> I am photon.  
> I am wave.  
> I am Gaia.  
>  
> Gaia sees.  
> Gaia breathes.  
> Gaia's needs.  
> Incomplete.  
> Gaia bequeaths.  
> Dirt is deceased.  
> Gaia dies.  
> No one sees.  
>  
> I am Gaia.  
>  
> Gaia.
