# Lyrics

> Clouds begin to tear  
> Sky is bleeding hair  
> God is weeping tears  
> You are full of fears  
>  
> Vehement lightning quake  
> Head begins to ache  
> Lord has thunder snake  
> Balrog he will break  
>  
> And thus revenge was fruitless for one who had been turned  
> And we are reminded who lords over this altered world  
>  
> Floating fire sky  
> Everything will die...  
>  
> Floating fire  
> Golden wire  
> Silver trails  
> Flashing spire  
>  
> Guns are cracking  
> Bombs are smacking  
> Cat o' tails  
> Whips her lashings  
>  
> Lord of lightning safe he  
> Pulls a golden stake  
> Launches into space and  
> Mutters to the beast one word:  
>  
> Lightning!
