# Lyrics

> Red smoke.  
> The wools been pulled.  
> The dust won't settle.  
> Red smoke.  
> The fools still rule.  
> The screaming kettles.  
>  
> We're numb to the norm.  
> Ever year it's clear that it ain't gonna disappear.  
> It ain't some passing storm we can hide from.  
>  
> Red smoke.  
> The wools been pulled.  
> The dust won't settle.  
> Red smoke.  
> The fools still rule.  
> The screaming kettles.  
>  
> Not the only ones stuck in a bubblе of terror watching them make all thе errors.  
> Like a kid with a magnifying glass.  
> Each summer is getting hotter than the one before.  
>  
> Red smoke.  
> Go away heatwave.  
> You're all around - north to the south.  
> Red smoke.  
> Go away heatwave.  
> You're burning down.  
> Our leaders are dumbfounded again.  
>  
> The answer.  
> Plain as day.  
> The answer.  
> Plain as day.  
> Drastic measures must be made before we incinerate.  
>  
> Red smoke.  
> The wools been pulled.  
> The dust won't settle.  
> Red smoke.  
> The fools still rule.  
> The screaming kettles.  
> Red smoke.  
> Go away heatwave.  
> You're all around - north to the south.  
> Red smoke.  
> Go away heatwave.  
> You're burning down.  
> Our leaders are dumbfounded again.
