# Lyrics

> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Wait for the answer to open the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
>  
> 1, 2, 3!  
> Loosen up  
> Time to drop  
> Fuck shit up  
> Don't forget about it  
> My coffin's all I see  
> Lately  
> Robot stop!  
>  
> Loosen up  
> Time to drop  
> Fuck shit up  
> Don't forget about it  
> My coffin's all I see  
> Lately  
> Robot stop!  
>  
> My body's overworked  
> It's just the same I know  
> When can my body work  
> Cold static overload  
> My body works I know  
> It's just the same I know  
> My only difference  
> Is robot influence  
>  
> I'm up here for the weirdo swarm  
> I'm the door when you come for more  
>  
> 1, 2, 3!  
> Limber up  
> Time is up  
> Fuck shit up  
> Don't forget about it  
> My coffin's all I see  
> Lately  
> Robot stop!  
>  
> My body's overworked  
> It's just the same I know  
> When can my body work  
> Cold static overload  
> My body works I know  
> It's just the same I know  
> My only difference  
> Is robot influence  
>  
> Upload me to the robot brain  
> I'm the drudge that goes again and again  
>  
> Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade  
> The robots here if the robots paid  
>  
> My body's overworked  
> It's just the same I know  
> When can my body work  
> Cold static overload  
> My body works I know  
> It's just the same I know  
> My only difference  
> Is robot influence  
>  
> I'm up here for the weirdo swarm  
> I'm the door when you come for more  
>  
> 1, 2, 3!  
>  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Nonagon infinity opens the door  
> Wait for the answer to open the door  
> Nonagon infinity
