# Lyrics

> I floated up and for the first time I could relax and unplug  
> My friend, it felt good  
>  
> To shuffle off this mortal coil  
> To rise like oil in water  
>  
> To be not real  
> To have no soul  
> To have no body  
>  
> I woke to an eye-adjusting fright  
> Baptised in the light and found myself in purgatory white  
> Dead again in the void  
>  
> What was the lesson, God?  
> No, no, no, no body  
> Are you real or not?  
> No, no, no, no body  
>  
> In death I know life was a hallucination
