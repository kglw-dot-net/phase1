# Lyrics

> I don't care  
> "Take a chance", you said  
> Melt the coins in your pants  
> But make no sound for me my friend  
>  
> Be calm in the wind  
> Tearing through town  
> A dog-less bark  
> Is a lonely sound  
>  
> The cold ground moans  
> Untold histories  
> It sings its birdsong  
> To me  
>  
> A family sleeps  
> At the crease  
> They died by fire  
> But they felt no heat  
> I could wear  
> A jumper sewn  
> Out of the  
> Irony  
>  
> We waste no time  
> Leaving in light  
> A different sun  
> Bakes the breeze tonight  
>  
> My mind wanders  
> Alone  
> Let my body  
> Be aquatic  
>  
> Burn us a road  
> Straight to the sea  
> I'll be your seatbelt  
> Baby  
>  
> A family sleeps  
> At the crease  
> They died by fire  
> But they felt no heat  
> I could wear  
> A jumper sewn  
> Out of the  
> Irony  
>  
> I could wear  
> A jumper sewn  
> Out of the  
> Irony
