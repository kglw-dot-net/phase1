# Lyrics

> Falling upwards through clouds of glue.  
> Anamnesis crashing through.  
> Blurry photos all I've gained from my last domain.  
>  
> Dream grips me and pulls me into global unparalleled new.  
> Metamorphic is my name.  
> Surrender this brain.  
>  
> Blue morpho... Blue morpho... Blue morpho...  
>  
> Falling upwards through clouds of glue.  
> Moonless night beckons me through.  
> Morpheus whispers my name.  
> Massages my brain.  
>  
> Falling upwards through clouds of glue.  
> Split dry sky beckons me through.  
> A hand outstretched calls my name.  
> Time to wake again.  
>  
> Blue morpho... Blue morpho... Blue morpho...  
>  
> Time to wake again, blue morpho.
