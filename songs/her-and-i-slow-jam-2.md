# Lyrics

> It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love  
> The sun shone through into a wave of thought  
> It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her  
> Her will will shine from up above on us  
>  
> Because every day I build on precious her and I  
> It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel  
> I'll fill her heart with a lot of love  
> So the sun can shine a little brighter  
>  
> On her and I
