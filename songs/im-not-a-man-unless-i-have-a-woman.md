# Lyrics

> Well I'm not a man unless I have a woman  
> Well I'm not a man unless I have a woman  
>  
> She's a hundred pounds of gold (yes I am)  
> She's a hundred pounds of gold  
> (He's a hundred pounds of gold)  
> I got mine so I don't mind - no  
> I'm not a woman unless I have a man  
> I'm not a woman unless I have a man  
>   
> I ain't gonna break your heart  
> (Yeah I know you won't)  
> Because I'm done breaking hearts
