# Lyrics

> Everybody's lazy when they're tired  
> Because everybody's sucking on fluoride  
> And everybody's filing into line  
> Because everybody's sucking on fluoride  
>  
> When I'm in your mind  
> Then I'm in your mind  
>  
> While everybody wants to suck you dry  
> And dig a little deeper in your mind - c'mon, deeper  
> Everybody's lazy because they're fried  
> Because everybody's sucking on fluoride
