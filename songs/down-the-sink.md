# Lyrics

> On the street  
> People make things happen  
> Concrete  
> Buildings greet the skyline  
> People meet  
> By the subway station  
> Feel the heat  
> From the sidewalk pavement  
> Under the city people's dreams collecting  
> Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin  
>  
> Down the sink  
> Back and forth follow the stream the city is bleak forget all your dreams  
> Down you'll go  
> You can't compete whatever it is you can't defeat the pull of the street  
> You follow the drain spinning around again and again again and again  
> Once you're in  
> Forget every place you've ever been the city is dark you'll never be clean  
> Bow your head  
>  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people live  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people die  
>  
> On the beat  
> Cops patrol the ally  
> People cheat  
> One another for some  
> Hanging meat  
> In the butcher's window  
> Bitter sweet  
> Stench from in the gutter  
> Under the city people's dreams collecting  
> Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin  
>  
> Down the sink  
> Back and forth follow the stream the city is bleak forget all your dreams  
> Down you'll go  
> You can't compete whatever it is you can't defeat the pull of the street  
> You follow the drain spinning around again and again again and again  
> Once you're in  
> Forget every place you've ever been the city is dark you'll never be clean  
> Bow your head  
>  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people live  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people live  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people live  
> The street  
> Is where  
> The street is where people die  
>  
> Under the city people's dreams collecting  
> Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin  
>  
> Down the sink  
> Down the sink  
> Down the sink  
> Down the sink
