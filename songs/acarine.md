# Lyrics

> I am the honeybee. Drink the blood of the tree.  
> I can't breathe, I can't see. Evil being; confusing.  
> 
> Buried deep inside of me: Acarine.  
> Buried deep inside of me: Acarine.  
>  
> Little mite; so much spite. Multiply, ruin life.  
> I can't fly. I can't cry. Acarine; make me die.  
>  
> Buried deep inside of me. Buried deep inside of me.  
> Buried deep inside of me: Acarine.  
>  
> Acarine.  
> Conduct larynx cesarean. Excise low life.  
> Acarine.
