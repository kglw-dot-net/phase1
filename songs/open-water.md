# Lyrics

> Open water  
> Where's the shore gone?  
> How'd I falter?  
> Open water  
>  
> Height of the sea  
> Will bury me  
> And all I see is  
> Open water  
>  
> Open water  
>  
> Open water  
> Where's the shore gone?  
> How'd I falter?  
> Open water  
>  
> Plight of poor me  
> No use for screaming here  
> I'll drown in  
> Open water  
>  
> Open water  
>  
> Open water  
> Where's the shore gone?  
> How'd I falter?  
> Open water  
>  
> The sea is all  
> That I can see  
> I'll die alone in  
> Open water  
>  
> Open water  
> Open water  
> Open water  
>  
> I know something is lurking in  
> The depths of murky water  
> There are ripples and bubbles appearing  
> Over by the sunken ship  
>  
> And bells are ringing in my head  
> I think I'm done - I think I'm dead  
> As something pulls my paddling leg under...  
>  
> Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take  
> This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs  
>  
> And deeper darker bluish dread  
> The pressure's squeezing on my head  
> The kraken's got the best of me this time  
>  
> I know something is lurking in  
> The depths of murky water  
> There are ripples and bubbles appearing  
> Over by the sunken ship  
>  
> And bells are ringing in my head  
> I think I'm done - I think I'm dead  
> As something pulls my paddling leg under...  
>  
> Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take  
> This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs  
>  
> And deeper darker bluish dread  
> The pressure's squeezing on my head  
> The kraken's got the best of me this time  
>  
> Open water  
> Where's the shore gone?  
> How'd I falter?  
> Open water
